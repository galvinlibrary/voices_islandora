                    <p>Remarks: 1. At the conclusion of the interview it occurred to me to try on Mrs. Bondy the question of "the three wishes." Her answers as I remember them were in substance thus: "I want my children back. The older one, the girl, is nine years old, and she has to start with her music lessons and a second language. I want an apartment." She threw a glance at her apparently American cast-off dress and said, "I want some clothes and furniture of my own." And then glancing at a horrible scar on her left arm produced by most clumsy surgery for the removal of her tattoo, she added, "I want some jewelry." [July 28, 1955, D. P. B.]</p>
                    <p>Remarks: 2. This is one of a group of interviews taken at one of the <placeName ref="Paris">Paris</placeName> offices of the <term ref="#vothG_ajdc">J.D.C.</term> When I appeared at the <term ref="#vothG_ajdc">J.D.C.</term> office I was informed that there positively was no space available with the required privacy for recorded interviews. As usual, I found some space, a storage room. There was trouble with the electric power. As far as I remember, I had to work with a transformer [from 220 to 110 volts], or possibly through the converter from DC to AC. There were frequent interruptions by messenger boys who needed their bicycles. There was also now and then some shrilling noise from nearby power machinery. However, the series contains some of the most extensive and instructive interviews, such as Mr. Feuer's, Mr. Schlaefrig, and the present one with Mrs. Bondy [July 25, 1955, D. P. B.]</p>
