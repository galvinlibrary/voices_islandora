The first song, 'The <placeName ref="Buchenwald concentration camp" type="camp">Buchenwald</placeName> Song,' is sung by many voices. The second, 'The Partisan Song,' is sung by one person with several people humming at times. —D.P.B.]</p>
                <p>[Note 2: The style of this interview appears especially full of somewhat artificial pathos. He is definitely a pleader, but of a cause which even then was not too popular. The frequent incorrect use of the participle in his Yiddish narrative has been translated verbatim, viz., 'Walking out of the door, the Ukrainians heard it,' for, 'When the prisoners walked out of the door, the Ukrainians...' etc. —D.P.B.]</p>

                <u who="#eisenbergK" start="480.242" end="x">As soon as the Germans entered our town we left immediately for another town, a small town in which very few people lived. Since our town was a manufacturing city with large factories, people were very scared. And a week's time, two weeks later when the German was already [there], we could not make a go of it in that small town so that we had to return to the [our] town. Soon during the journey we were stopped by Germans and searched. The little property [belongings] that we had was taken away from us on the road and distributed among the Poles, the Gentiles. And afterwards, when we came back to the town, we did not find anthing in the house any more. Everything had been taken out, and everything had been robbed by other neighbors. And in the town there were very few people. Soon on the next day, it was on 'Yom Kipper,' coming out next morning, the synagogue was already no more. We saw already it is in flames. That old synagogue that had been standing for years and years was lit up in flames. In the middle of the night, in the middle of the night on the second day, the synagogue was still burning. As propaganda, people had to take the rabbi and sign that the synagogue had been set on fire by ourselves. And we had to save [fight the fire] by ourselves. And who...and whoever came out to [try and] save the synagogue, they were beaten with terrible beatings, and also a few people were shot. And later on, when there had already passed a long, quite a long time, they were then...the Jews were then separated from the... from the Poles. The Jews had to live then in special houses on special streets where no Pole was allowed to enter. And soon there began very hard living conditions. And afterwards, after quite a long time, there was...there was...there was...issued an order from the German authorities that all Jews have to wear the bands. And [he] who does not have a band on his arm, he receives 'ten years' punishment, or else be shot [?] on the spot. Many cases happened when a Jew in that crowded <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</term>, where he was living and could not sustain himself and his family, was forced to go out on the...on the forbidden streets. And many times it happened that Jews out of luck were shot, and half a year later an order came out that everyone from eighteen to forty-five has to report to the Jewish council...council. The next day at eight o'clock in the morning all the Jews in the town reported and [were] led out to a square, guarded by Germans, and there we stood without eating or drinking a whole day. In the evening, herded like cattle into RR-cars and shipped away. Many people, one may say...report that fifty per cent remained there in the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>... </u>

The mother, to earn for bread she could not, because she had to stay only on the streets that had been assigned. And on the other streets where the Christians, the Gentiles, were living we could not go out on any more, and so it was very hard, that life. Returning home at night, sometimes I would find a potato without salt, and sometimes there was not even that. And early in the morning, again with the same hunger, return to the same work that a hundred per cent...fifty per cent, one can say, I did not expect to return, because [one was] without strength and getting beaten very much. All of a sudden Jews from all over begin to arrive in our town. There begins a traffic with autos, with trains. From all over Jews begin arriving. And so what is going on? There is a bustle in the town. People are being resettled. People are being resettled from all the towns to <placeName ref="Treblinka concentration camp" type="camp">Treblinka</placeName> from where people do not return any more, the death <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> which is known all over the world, <placeName ref="Treblinka concentration camp" type="camp">Treblinka</placeName>. We are thinking about a way out, but there is no way out. Thus it was going on for two weeks. One bright...bright morning a five o'clock, the whole town is guarded, surrounded, and an order was given that in ten minutes not one Jewish child [son or daughter of Israel] is to be found in his home. And many Jews...and many Jews were prepared for it. We slept with the clothes on. [He used the word Ungetuigs for clothes which was not understood by the interviewer.]</u>

                <u who="#eisenbergK" start="991.198" end="x">We slept with clothes on, in the trousers, the jacket, the shirt, everything ready, and a small bundle at the head. We took that bundle and ran out at once. Coming out of the house, there were already waiting Germans with guns, with grenades in the hands.</u>
                <u who="#boderD" start="1006.241" end="x">Only children?</u>

There were already Germans waiting with grenades, with machine guns in the hands and looked for the moment to kill us. But we had...but we were following the order, and it did not last...did not take ten minutes to come out. Coming out on the street, I once more...I, myself, looked back once again at my house, and I said, 'This house I will not see again.' We went out to the market place. This is a large square in the center of town. All the Jews were assembled there. Walking, we already saw how Jewish blood flows in the streets, and the bullets are flying. When we were already assembled on the square, we see an old couple walking. They have no more strength to drag their feet. So a German takes and leads [them] into a house and with one bullet he shot both of them. Put one next to the other, both heads, and shot both. Going ahead, looking around the town again, we see the children lost from their mothers and mothers lost from their children. They are calling, the mothers to the children and the children to the mothers. But those children whom the Germans had noticed, who had from great fright lost their mothers, died immediately on the spot. Such a panic lasted four, five hours. It was terrible. Also while standing in rows, the Germans came over and took off immediately everything, the better things. I myself was dressed in my best suit, my best clothes. They soon took off my jacket and my boots, and they asked if I do not have any money or anything else.</u>

You are going with us. Whatever will happen to us will happen to you, too.' At a short distance passed an <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term> man, and [he] immediately took off my jacket and a pair of boots. I remained barefooted. Luckily I had in my bundle a pair of old shoes that I had taken along. I put [them] on and stood dismayed, mornful, seeing what is happening to Jews. How the blood flows, and the little children taken by the feet and thrown against the wall. And later on when the afternoon came, everybody was tired standing on that square. There suddenly arrived an auto with five <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term> men. And they said for all young men from eighteen to twenty-five to fall in, to be taken to work. I was a boy of fourteen years. I did not have the chance to step forward. But suddenly an <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term> man was passing, and he took a liking to me. He gave me a sign with his revolver, and I had to step our from the ranks, and with a heavy...with an embittered heart I looked at the mother and left the ranks, [and was] incorporated into the ranks of the workers. Once more I wanted to turn and take a look at my mother. I soon got [it] with a riding crop over the head that to this day I still have a souvenir of that instant. </u>

And with that, with such an embittered heart, did I go out from the ranks. Arriving in the new <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>, we were spread out in two places. We separately, and the women, very few, separately. When we where standing on that square an order came to hand over whatever we still had. All our things on one side and the rest that we have, to throw away. We went over to the other side. The things we left on the place on which we were formerly...standing before. And later on there arrived a few <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term> men and gave an order, 'In the name of our <term ref="#vothG_fuehrer">Fuehrer</term> ten people will be shoot.'

It looked like Tishe B'ab [a fast day commemorating the destruction of the Temple], like Chorben Beth Hamigdash [Destruction of the Temple]. So it looked. Everybody was thinking about what had happened to the parents and to the other people who had remained there on that square. In such...in such a mood [?] we sat till the evening. The night fell slowly. It fell gradually, and everybody on the plank beds, bewildered, confused, brooding. There was no question of sleeping. The desire to sleep came to nobody's mind. I, as a young boy, sit and cry and complain. With whon did I remain? And what will I do? And what will the future be? Lost. There is no hope. I myself must summon courage that I should be able to live through that moment and be able to relate to the Jews all over, in every corner or the world, in each of the four corners of the world, what has happened to the...to us. The story, the times we have gone through. In the middle of the night everyone sits exhausted, in thoughts. Suddenly we hear a shot.

But, thank God, it only cost three burned offerings and two wounded. And so, tacken aback by the dead and by the wounded, there was no councel or aid. We had no water. To go out was a threat of death. And so gradually with our own efforts we did whatever we could in order to alleviate their suffering, to reduce their plight. Dawn was nearing slowly. We all arose, and we wanted to go to work. We thought that if we remain lying they will take it for sabotage, that we do not want to go to work. So we all arose and went to work. [While the prisoners were] walking out through the door, the Ukrainians heard it. They immediately surrounded our barrack and fell upon us like murderers, with machine guns in the hands, and were beating with rubber truncheons. 'What do you think, you Jew? You band of Jews, what do you think, you have any way out of this <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>? Here you must remain! Here you must croak!

                <u who="#eisenbergK" start="1806.749" end="x">A Jew. His name was [first name not clear] Wilczyk. Born also...born I do not know where, but he had been living for a long time in <placeName ref="Starachowice">Starachowice</placeName>. An elderly Jew around forty years.

The guards [authorities] of the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> made him so temporarily. And he came in...he came into the <term ref="#vothG_block">block</term>, and he told us to get dressed and go to work. In five minutes everybody was ready, because nobody had slept, nobody had undressed. Everybody was depressed, crush-...crushed by his...by his misfortunes, by his pain. [We were] arranged on the square and went to work Going out through the gate we received the bread which we took along among our things. Everyone received a slice of around ten dekas, five dekas. It depended on how much luck one had. And a little bitter, cold, unsweetened coffee. That was the first day of our going out to work. When we arrived at work...[when we were] entering the factory, the Ukrainians received us with bad beatings [?]. We were assigned to sections in Polish, 'Do wydzial' [to work halls] where everyone was to work. We immediately got the worst kind of work. We, Jews children, were taken,of eighteen, or seventeen, of sixteen years, [and] assigned to ovens of two thousand degrees of heat. They made ammunition, cannon...shells for cannon. And who did not complete the 'norm' like one says in Polish, that means the number that he was supposed to make--that was two thousand to three thousand shells--had to stand sixteen hours. And if I did not finish in sixteen hours, he [I?] Had to remain for twenty-four hours. That is how it was going on every day, the day by day work. In a short time very, very many people had fallen who did not have the strength to endure all those things. When the...when the Russians had come closer, [when] they came near the Vistula, the Germans considered it a danger if we should remain in the place, and we have to be sent away to [the interior of] Germany. At night there came an order that not one Jew is to go to work but has to remain in the place, on that spot, in the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>. A terrible fright gripped the whole lager. Everybody walked around brooding and said, 'Now [these] are our last moments. The Russians are approaching and the Germans knows that he has lost the war. He will finish us all off on the spot just where we are.' Two three...two days this situation [?] lasted.</u>

The section which is working from seven in the morning till three in the afternoon can still go to work. It became a little easier, but still people were still going around with the same fright. [The continuity seems disrupted.] Arriving at work, the Gentiles, the Christians, told us the terrible agony that was experienced by the people who had remained there on the square. Because until now we had had no information, and later on we had some information from people who had returned...who were taken as far as <placeName ref="Treblinka concentration camp" type="camp">Treblinka</placeName> and after that they returned. And part of those people [possibly Christians] were also working there in the factory, who were driving the wagons, the engines from on factory to another. An acquaintance, a Jew, was acquainted with such a machinist, and he told him about the terrible tortures that the Jews, those people had suffered, who had been taken away. First of all, a hundred and fifty people were packed into a small RR-car. Entirely closed, nailed shut, doused with chloride [chlorek]. And the bundles taken away, and the water they needed. And chased inside [the RR-cars], beaten up, grabbed bloody, herded into the RR-cars. That Christian reported the impossible thing that fifty per cent would arrive half alive at that place. He said that he is completely convinced that not a single Jew will [could] arrive at that place alive, not withstanding that the place as such was the death sentence. That means <placeName ref="Treblinka concentration camp" type="camp">Treblinka</placeName>. Returning from work, we heard that the guards had searched the entire plant [to see] whether, God forbid, a Jew did not hide himself there and escape at night into the forest and hide himself. </u>

Absolutely nothing to say. In the afternoon a decision was made by the Jews that from this <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> we have to get away. Should we remain till next morning there are definite rumors that we will be shot. At night everyone was awake. No one slept. The police [apparently Jewish <term ref="#vothG_trusty">trusties</term>] came into each barrack and said 'Jews, the last moments of our lives are approaching, and so we have one way out, to break out of the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>. And not far from the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> there is a forest. It is quite certain that many Jews will fall but this cannot be helped.

There is no place where we could be taken. There is no place, and the Germans will not let us live. It is an impossible thing that they will let us live.' At night, everything ready, a little bundle in the hand, with hammers, with pliers, with axes, [we] went over to the...eh...went over to the wires. There was no strong guard. And so on all four side Jews were standing and watched for the moment to be able to go over, tear out the fence and escape into the forest. Thus it lasted four, five, ten minutes. After that there came people running from all four sides and breaking the boards and cutting the wires. And a few people running from all four sides and breaking the boards and cutting the wires. And a few people succeeded in escaping. At the same moment fire began falling from all four roofs, from the towers where the guards stood, and many, many were shot and a very small part escaped into the woods. But the majority of Jews were afraid to risk [it] and did not have the possibilities any more of running over to the fence and running away, because death awaited them immediately.</u>

                <u who="#eisenbergK" start="x" end="x">Afterwards from the Gypsy Later we came to be in <placeName ref="Monowitz concentration camp" type="camp">Buna</placeName>. In <placeName ref="Monowitz concentration camp" type="camp">Buna</placeName> I was a short time. And there, too, happened very many tragic moments about which there is much to tell.

Not far from <placeName ref="Gleiwitz" type="camp">Gleiwitz</placeName> there was a railroad station where RR-cars were waiting for us, open RR-cars.

                <u who="#boderD" start="x" end="x">Kalman, how do you explain the fact that the Germans dragged you from one <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> to another, and that they did not do away with you as with the Gypsies?</u>
                <u who="#eisenbergK" start="x" end="x">It was an accident. Perhaps they did not have any more time to do the same to us, or they still had a figured-out moment [idea] that some people must remain, or they had yet another place to employ us. That is why, perhaps, they left us. One cannot know for sure why. Perhaps we were lucky, perhaps by a miracle, by accident. We do not know how, whether by accident, but we were driven on. And when...yes. Near <placeName ref="Gleiwitz" type="camp">Gleiwitz</placeName>, having boarded the RR-cars, we drove in January in the severest frosts for twelve days. We had nothing to eat, just the thirty dekas of bread that we took along. We drove through Czechoslovakia, Austria. And in Austria there is a famous <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>, <placeName ref="Mauthausen concentration camp" type="camp">Mauthausen</placeName>. We stood there a whole day. They did not want to receive us. It was filled up. We drove back from [through?] Austria, back to Czechoslovakia. And on the road fifty per cent of the people died, frozen from the cold, of hunger, and of thirst. When someone died -- it was very crowed -- he was simply taken and thrown down the hills and valleys, wherever the place of his death happened to be, and covered with snow. And many people 'don't even know' where their bones have come to be [affective distortion of linguistic structure]. En route back from Czechia many Czechs were tossing out bread, and many Czechs suffered from the Germans, because they had tossed out bread [to us]. But we arrived in <placeName ref="Flossenbürg concentration camp" type="camp">Flossenburg</placeName>. Entering <placeName ref="Flossenbürg concentration camp" type="camp">Flossenburg</placeName>, sixty percent of us was missing. The forty per cent arrived more dead than alive. We, the young ones, were taken into a special <term ref="#vothG_block">block</term> for you-...youth, into <term ref="#vothG_block">Block</term> 19. And we were immediately taken to the bath, washed up, and chased into the <term ref="#vothG_block">block</term>. Inside the <term ref="#vothG_block">block</term> the names of the Jews were immediately called out, and we were put to the side. We were given special rows of beds, and wired up with wire so that we should not be able to talk to the other boys. We, as Jews, were all wired up. In <placeName ref="Flossenbürg concentration camp" type="camp">Flossenburg</placeName> there were very hard moments to live through. There were many days in which we received twenty dekas of moldy bread and a little water -- this was the soup, made out of water and leaves, nothing else. But we succeeded in living through the time. In a short time we were again taken from <placeName ref="Monowitz concentration camp" type="camp">Buna</placeName>. But they had no more places to take us to. They thought that they will get rid of us in...in <placeName ref="Dachau concentration camp" type="camp">Dachau</placeName>. In <placeName ref="Dachau concentration camp" type="camp">Dachau</placeName> there awaited us already a place where we could be exterminated. But they did not succeed in taking us as far as that. We...we dragged along for two weeks. During the night we walked, and during the day we lay in the woods. Four, five days...</u>
                <u who="#boderD" start="x" end="x">Why did you...why did you lie in the woods?</u>
                <u who="#eisenbergK" start="x" end="x">Because they had no other place in which to hide us except in the woods. During the night we marched on the highway, and during the day we lay in the woods.</u>
                <u who="#boderD" start="x" end="x">Why were you hiding in the woods?</u>
                <u who="#eisenbergK" start="x" end="x">They had no place to hide us. There was no other place. </u>
                <u who="#boderD" start="x" end="x">How.</u>
                <u who="#eisenbergK" start="x" end="x">They had occupied...the Russians, Americans, and the English had occupied. So they kept us in the woods. There were no more <term ref="#vothG_lager">lagers</term> for us. While in the woods, we lay [there] for five days during which it rained continuously. It rained for five days, and we received...received no food, nothing. We ate the dried out [bitter?] berries, if we happened to sit close to them. But in case we wanted to go near [them], to go and look for the dried out [bitter?] berries, one was shot. One was not permitted. Fifty boys sat together, separated into groups, parties [?] of fifty. And around every group of fifty there stood twenty <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term> men with dogs. And to move two meters away from the group was punishable by death. After three days they brought a few liters of water, called out everybody's name, and measured out a spoonful of water. And this was the food supply...the food...the food supply [Verpflegung], as it is called in German, for three days. And for the other two days we lay in the rain. At night, when one side, when I got up I could not feel the side I lay on, if it is alive or...or dead. I could have been beaten or pricked. I could feel absolutely nothing.</u>

                <u who="#eisenbergK" start="x" end="x">And then there arrived...and then there arrived comrades from <placeName ref="Buchenwald concentration camp" type="camp">Buchenwald</placeName> who had...whom we had met on the road. And they had also gone through the same hardships. And we walked on. We walked again at night, and again we lay in the woods during the day. But this could not go on for long, because many people fell. Fell. Simply fell. And every meter there were corpses lying on both sides [of the road]. When one did not have the strength to go on, he would sit down. And a minute later he was lying already dead. To get us to <placeName ref="Dachau concentration camp" type="camp">Dachau</placeName>...they could not bring [us there], because the communications were disrupted. To ride in RR-cars -- the American and Russian airplanes shot up the RR-cars and locomotives the...the train, and we could not travel any farther. And they could not bring us to that certain place where they wanted to exterminate us. But they took each group, took them into a forest and surrounded [them], dug...ordered to dig their own ditches [mass graves], and bury themselves. But we, before...before that...before that...our group simply by accident had before that gone to a small town where we received three potatoes each, half boiled. And we were supposed to go to the place where we were going to be shot, but the road...we got lost on the road and walked in a different direction. And by this miracle we remained alive. And the others, six thousand who had left the lag-...six thousand Jews who had left the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>, were shot, and no trace [of them] has remained. Our group, the fifty people who kept together, who took the wrong road, succeeded in remaining alive. When the...when the Americans were already very close, the Germans were chasing us faster and faster. But we did not want to walk. There was an air-raid alarm, and they ran into the forest. Then I and another three comrades from my town ran to the other side of the forest and hid ourselves. The German looked for us and could not find us. After having been in the forest two, three hours, we saw a village burning, and nearby there stands a tank with the lettering 'U.S.A.' We knew that U.S,A. stands for American. We also saw the star. But we did not believe that we would live to see the happy moment of liberation. Walking out a little farther, we see oncoming tanks, Americans. The first thing when we went over to the tank, there was a man with gun in hand. And he asked us who we are. He saw at once that we are...</u>
