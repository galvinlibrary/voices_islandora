And the Germans prepared a large crematory. They had heard that the front is again approaching. They prepared a large crematory, but they did not have enough time to do it. One nice day they called together all the Jews, and they wanted to make an air-raid alarm so that we go down into that bunker. There came a German and betrayed [divulged] all that.
