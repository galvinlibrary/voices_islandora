A home of displaced children. September 7, 1946. [Incorrect date -- should be Spetember 8]. We are going to interview Mr. Joseph Ferber, 33 years old, a teacher of sports and a general instructor at the school for displaced children under the direction of Miss Lena Kuechler. </u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="33.451" end="x">[In Yiddish:] And so, Mr. Ferber, would you tell me again where you are from and where you were when the war began?</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="43.500" end="x">I was born in <placeName ref="Brody">Brody</placeName>,<note n="1">Brody (Yid. Brod) was in the Tarnopol district of Poland (then southeastern Poland, now northwestern Ukraine). The town was a center of nineteenth century Jewish progressive thinking and had a strong Zionist movement. In September, 1939, the Soviets occupied the city, but the Germans took over shortly after the beginning of their invasion of the Soviet Union on June, 22, 1941. During the German occupation, the Jews of Brody were terrorized, persecuted, ghettoized and then murdered. Only about 250 of the 9,000 Jews in Brody on the eve of World War II survived.</note> on the former Austro-Russian border. Later the town belonged to Poland. There I went to school, gymnasium [middle-level schools] and then I went to <placeName ref="Kraków">Cracow</placeName>, where I was working until the year 1939.<note n="2">Located in southern Poland, the historic city was for several centuries the capital of the early Polish kingdom. Jewish settlement in Kraków dates from at least the early fourteenth century. During the German occupation, the city became the seat of the Nazi General Government run by the notorious Hans Frank.</note></u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="66.717" end="x">At what were you working?</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="68.061" end="x">As a bookkeeper.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="69.514" end="x">Hm.</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="70.311" end="x">When the German-Polish war began I returned to <placeName ref="Brody">Brody</placeName>. There I...the Soviets had come there on the seventeenth of September, 1939. Under them I also worked as a teller in a bank, as inspector, and then also as a bookkeeper.<note n="3">Mr. Ferber is referring to the outbreak of World War II which began with the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. Two days later France and Great Britain declared war on Germany.</note></u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="93.670" end="x">And so tell me, Mr. Ferber, how did that suddenly change from the Polish government to the Soviet? Did they immediately install in your place the whole Soviet regime?</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="111.560" end="x">No. Following the escape in September, during the war, of the Polish government to Rumania, the Soviet government declared that all political and diplomatic relations between them are terminated. On the 17th of September the Red Army received an order to march into West Ukraine and West White Russia in order to liberate the people who were living there as a part of the people of Great Ukraine and of White Russia. After the Soviets were there a month they made a plebiscite, elections. The elections took place in all cities, towns, and villages. Then in <placeName ref="Lviv">Lemberg</placeName>, during the assembly of all the elected deputies, it was decided to turn to the highest council of Soviet Russia with the request that these countries should be recognized as a part of Soviet Russia. And by this procedure these countries were accepted into the Soviet Union, and they became recognized as part of the country. [Pause.]<note n="4">In fact, the Soviet Union occupied eastern Poland in accordance with a secret protocol in the Nazi Soviet pact signed on August 23, 1939 between the foreign ministers of the two totalitarian powers. The protocol called for the division of Poland between them by force of arms.</note></u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="148.808" end="x">Go on.</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="149.511" end="x">Well, [the conditions] there were quite good. One cannot say that it was not good. Social justice was established. Everybody had to work. Large private fortunes, factories, and large estates became nationalized; that means were transferred as property of the state. Everybody had to go to work. Everyone had a right to work, everyone had a right to an education. The Jews had every right, not like it was before under the Polish government where Jewish students in the universities used to be beaten with sticks and pummeled, where there were many victims. Now everyone had equal rights and equal chances for a life. <note n="5">Treatment of the Jewish population under Soviet rule was certainly better than under the German occupation. However, in the part of Poland under their control, the Soviets nationalized large Jewish businesses and factories, confiscated and collectivized land, ended any semblance of Jewish political and social autonomy, and deported the "hostile class element" to Siberia. These policies impacted the general population as well.</note></u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="225.059" end="x">The Poles, however, still remained there in Poland. Did they express any anti-Semitism?</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="234.918" end="x">The majority of such rabid Poles who had been planted there by the Polish government that they should polonize the land were taken out deep into Russia. And the rest had to sit quietly. They waited until the war started on June 22, 1941.<note n="6">Eastern Poland during the interwar period was home to many Ukrainians as well as Jews. This accounted for the efforts of the Polish government to "polonize" the area.</note></u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="256.026" end="x">Hm.</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="256.745" end="x">At that time, on the first day, I was drafted into the Red Army. At that time, one can say, emerged anew all those Polish anti-Soviet elements which, in the first days of the war, carried out sabotage, who had shot [sniped] from the windows and from the roofs at the...at our...at the Red army, so that there was a great chaos and the Red Army had to retreat. Retreated far, until, until Stalingrad. I, too, went with the Red army as far as <placeName ref="Volgograd">Stalingrad</placeName>, and there I have been during the whole time . During all that time I took part in the heavy battles, for which I also received a medal, for the defense of <placeName ref="Volgograd">Stalingrad</placeName>.<note n="7">The Soviets drafted a number of Jews from Brody into the Red army. In total, about half a million Jews served in the Red army during World War II, and approximately 200,000 fell in battle. Some 160,000, including Mr. Ferber, were awarded medals for bravery. The German invasion of the Soviet Union came as a great shock to Stalin, who believed that Hitler would honor the August 1939 non-aggression treaty signed between the two countries. News of German atrocities against Jews in their zone of occupation from 1939-1941 was deliberately withheld from Soviet Jewry who were unprepared for the Nazi onslaught, as was the Red army which was overwhelmed in the early phase of the brutal war. The battle of Stalingrad, lasting from late summer 1942 until the German surrender on February 2, 1943, marked the turning point of the war on the eastern front.</note></u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="298.400" end="x">How long were you in the Red army?</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="302.916" end="x">I was in the Red army close to four and a half years, since the first day of the war until at this time a year ago when I was released as a former Polish citizen. I was discharged and I went back to <placeName ref="Kraków">Cracow</placeName>, but before that I had gone through with the Red army, taking part in the offensive. From <placeName ref="Volgograd">Stalingrad</placeName>, we went through all Russia, the Ukraine, and together with the Second Ukrainian front of Marshal Ross... Rokossovsky, no...pardon, Malinovski, I came to...we went through Hungary, through Rumania, through Czechoslavakia and finally Austria. There, on the 9th of May, 1945, we finished the war.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="345.217" end="x">Hm. There you were demobilized?</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="347.106" end="x">No, I was demobilized still later, when I returned to Soviet Russia, to <placeName ref="Chernivtsi">Chernovtsy</placeName>.<note n="9">Chernevtsky was a town located in western Ukraine. It was occupied by Romania, Germany's World War II ally. During the Romanian occupation, the Jews of Chernevtsky were persecuted and ghettoized, and their population was decimated.</note></u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="352.997" end="x">Hm.</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="353.685" end="x">There I was freed. From there I went back to Poland, to <placeName ref="Kraków">Cracow</placeName>.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="358.278" end="x">Did they permit anyone to leave who wanted to?</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="360.620" end="x">Yes. All former Polish citizens had a right to be set free according to the treaty which was effected by the Soviet and Polish governments, of the 6th of July, 1945.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="373.266" end="x">'45.</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="374.579" end="x">Had a right to return to Poland. On this ground many, many former Polish citizens are even today returning from Soviet Russia to Poland.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="383.329" end="x">They are still returning now?</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="384.907" end="x">Even now there is going on...which is called repatriation.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="388.626" end="x">Hm.</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="389.079" end="x">The great repatriation which is going on even today.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="391.719" end="x">They are returning from Siberia and from...</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="393.453" end="x">From Siberia...and from whole Russia. All those who were...who had escaped during the war to Soviet Russia and were in the defense deep in the country, all those have remained alive. In contrast, when we were advancing with the offensive, in all the countries, in all the towns where we had passed, where once had lived Jewish masses, we found nobody, only destruction and graves. Often, not even graves, because the majority of the Jews, nearly all without exceptions, also my whole family, all had been taken away either to <placeName ref="Belzec concentration camp" type="camp">Belzec</placeName>, or to <placeName ref="Treblinka concentration camp" type="camp">Treblinka</placeName>, or to <placeName ref="Auschwitz concentration camp" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName> and to other <term ref="#vothG_lager">lagers</term>, where they were burned in the crematories. So that returning home -- I was in my native town -- I did not find anybody.<note n="10">About 165,000 Polish Jews were repatriated under the Polish/Soviet repatriation agreement of July 1945. Some 20,000 went back to Poland under a subsequent agreement. About seven percent of the prewar Polish Jewish population was saved within the Soviet Union. Belzec and Treblinka were Nazi extermination camps designed to annihilate the Jews of the General Government. Auschwitz was the largest of the extermination camps and also a concentration camp. It had some forty subcamps. Like Mr. Ferber, many survivors experienced the loss of their entire families. </note></u>

                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="1327.650" end="x">In Palestine.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="1328.400" end="x">Tell me something about your service in Russia. Can you explain to me why the Jews, who had entered...saved themselves in Russia, don't want ...why don't they want to remain there? </u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="1345.601" end="x">Every Jew hopes that he will still find someone at home, that he will perhaps find his house, his belongings, or something else. And this, in fact, is the quintessence, that everyone is drawn to the place where he was born. Because in fact, from my own experience, in Russia the Jews have it, indeed very good. On the whole one cannot complain. The concept of anti-Semitism does not exist there. But every man is drawn to the place where he was born. This is simply such a sentiment. And besides that, this has to be taken into account. Every man...I had many friends from <placeName ref="Kraków">Cracow</placeName> who returned, because they owned homes there, they had large possessions. And occasionally they also succeed in getting it back, but on the other side, it sometimes leads again to [becoming] victims, for the reason that the Poles, seeing a Jew returning who says,'This was my house. This was my dwelling. These are my possessions'...so they go and kill such a Jew because they do not want to return his possessions which they had grabbed at the time when the Germans were there.<note n="23">In fact, especially by the late 1930's, anti-Semitic attitudes had become widespread among the Soviet elite and were held by many in the general population. Throughout the war, the Jews were not recognized as special victims of Nazi genocide, and this concealment continued after the war. From 1948 to 1953, the Black Years of Soviet Jewry, anti-Semitism became one of the chief policies of the Stalinist regime. </note></u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="1415.416" end="x">Nu, you say that in Poland the government is, more or less, liberal. Would it not be sensible to remain there and to combat the anti-Semitism, and to settle there and build there Jewish communities until the situation in Palestine will clear up?</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="1439.447" end="x">Something else is to be considered here. On the ruins which we find we do not want to build any more. When we come and find a burned home, a destroyed workshop, seeing that we have lost everything, everything that was dear was killed, we do not want to build any more on these ruins. And because of that the Jew thinks, if to start building, it is better to build in his own homeland, in one's own land. This is one [reason]. And the second -- it is the unceasing danger which threatens. This is the peril to one's life. Because in Poland, as I have said before, exists a strong reactionary force which is committing murder and acts of death on every Jew that they chase in the street or even in his own home. An example of this is the <term ref="#vothG_pogrom">pogrom</term> which took place at this time a year ago in <placeName ref="Kraków">Cracow</placeName> and a month ago in <placeName ref="Kielce">Kielce</placeName>,<note n="24">The Polish perpetrators of the Kielce pogrom on July 4, 1946 massacred forty-two Jews in the town of Kielce in southeastern Poland and wounded fifty more. The pogrom was sparked by a rumor that Jews were killing Polish children and drinking their blood. This event sparked a mass exodus of tens of thousands of Jews from Poland and other countries of eastern Europe who despaired of rebuilding productive and secure lives there.</note> where from the Shaarith Hapleta [that is, from a few hundred remaining Jews] ...<note n="25">She'erit ha-Peletah ("surviving remnant") is a term taken from First Chronicles 4:43. This was the Hebrew name given to the organization of Holocaust survivors, most in displaced persons' camps, following the war. The organization's primary goals were emigration of Jews from Europe primarily to settle in Palestine. It existed from 1945 until December, 1950 when its Central Committee ceased to exist.</note></u>

And we are working for an idea [ideal], to raise again children in order that they grow up to be good, fine people. These children love us very much, as much as one loves his own father and his own mother. We have a case where relatives of these children who live in America have contacted the children. They sent them papers and asked that the children should come to them, and the children decline it. The children say there where our head mistress will go, where our teachers will go, where our upbringers will be, there we want to be together with them, and all of us together have only one thought and one idea, to go to <term ref="#vothG_eretzY">Eretz Yisroeil</term>.</u>

                    <u who="#boderD" start="1692.458" end="x">Do you think that it is possible to raise good people in such -- I understand good people -- but is it the best thing to do, to raise children in such groups, instead of giving them...of distributing them among families?</u>
                    <u who="#ferberJ" start="1711.267" end="x"> [Pause.] Yes. Because the facts show that a private life has many more faults than a collective life. We see, for instance, that to our children the concept of egoism is completely alien. In them egoism became completely discarded. We never see an instance when a child should....If a child gets something, something from a friend, a toy or something to eat, the child always shares with all the other children. There never happen incidents that one child should want more, or another child should want less. The children are living under truly just, social ideals. This is the great plus [asset] in our work. This, indeed, raises our courage for our further work, to go on raising these children in a social and democratic spirit. [Pause.]</u>

When we hear the name Jew, or when we happen to meet on the street a Jew, there awakens in our [hearts] a great mass of really deep feelings. And for this reason, too, our sentiments for Jewry are much greater than previously. And today, when we hear that in America lives a large number of Jews who work and earn and have a free life, we would wish them to remember us, too, that they should always remember that we, today, when we have nothing -- we only have good martyrs, good...a strong will and good strivings -- that these brothers of ours in America should help us, be it morally and be it materially.
