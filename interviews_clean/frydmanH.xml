                    <u who="#frydmanH" start="1509.435" end="x">The Resistance was formed through small groups of young people, who belonged to various clubs. Sport clubs managed to get together. At school they also had talks among themselves. In my group we made a Jewish section, because Jews had other methods of action. They could not move around freely, and at first could not do the same things as the others, because to supply them with false identification papers was not a matter of one day. So it was a section of the Resistance. It wasn't the business of one day to manage the papers. So we had to find a place to live till the false papers were arranged, and that was not easy. In a few months, in three months, we started working with the French cells. Just like the French. A number of us became French <term ref="#vothG_partisans">Partisans</term>. <term ref="#vothG_partisans">Partisans</term> you have heard about. Many of us worked in propaganda. Others of us worked in solidarity units, that is, to help the mothers who had remained with children. And many of us were arrested in a short time but that could not scare us; we went on with our work. It is understood that in spite of the fact that we were in the Resistance, we had different viewpoints. The groups originated not only in sport groups, but also there were various political groups. I belonged to the Communist youth.<note n="11">The French communist resistance movement was energized by the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June 21, 1941 and the abrogation of the Stalin-Hitler Pact. Although Henja was at first in a specifically Jewish section of the communist resistance (which contained a number of Polish-born Jews), she indicates that her section later merged with the general communist resistance movement. The acronym for the military branch of the communist resistance was FTP-MOI.</note></u>

Not for them, but against them, he had to take his position. That is what I told my father. My parents were already old, about fifty-six, and of course they could not share my views. They feared for their daughter and they thought that if she would live with them she would be at home and could be protected by a [work] certificate. She would be able to leave the terrible conditions, so to speak, in which we all found ourselves. I couldn't say that my father worked for the Germans. No. He did not work for them. Through his connections he got a certificate. My brother was working, like many young people, in a factory which previously was a factory of fur jackets. But the difference was that [now] the fur jackets were going to Germany, whether we cared to know or not. That was the situation. I did not return home and so I got torn away from my parents.

They asked me what I was living from, what my occupation was, and one of them held his hand raised, so in case I did not answer, he would strike me. I continued laughing. They asked me why I laughed. So I told them, 'I am laughing at you. At your three revolvers that are pointed at me. I have nothing.' They told me to get my things ready, to come with them to the station. Then came up the man in charge of the inspectors, and he immediately started questioning me, one question after the other, believing that he would get out from me immediately the truth.

One did not need, for them, a very smart yarn. I asked the inspectors permission--excuse me, but I have to recollect the events. But I want to show you how far the French inspectors were already educated--one really can't say even educated, because they had not time to get educated. They were already corrupt. I asked his permission to go to the toilet. So one of the inspectors led me all the way to the toilet, and he did not close the door. He followed me every step and spoke ugly words. For the first time in my life my feminine dignity was attacked. I could not imagine that there are in the world such men. They took me to the station.

Before coming to Drancy he had helped deport Jews from Vienna, Moravia and Greece. Once installed at Drancy, Brunner removed the Vichy-appointed camp commander and ran it with the help of SS officers. His rule was characterized by a marked deterioration of conditions for the inmates and concerted efforts to deport imprisoned Jews to Auschwitz. After the war Brunner disappeared. He was not tried at Nuremberg, but was tried in absentia in Paris in 1954 and sentenced to death. However, he was eventually granted asylum in Syria and lived there for many years under an assumed name. Brunner was never brought to justice.</note> [Footnote: One cannot help observing that the first half of the story of Brenner was told in a rather hesitant and phlegmatic way. One cannot really be sure whether she is informed of the facts or not. Or is it, as in so many cases of <term ref="#vothG_dp">DPs</term>, that she really does not want to talk about the Germans and whatever happened to them? Only in the second part, when she begins, 'and there was a reason for' she becomes animated and persuasive.] [After a pause] He came, and they prepared lists. Each one was questioned. They did not say for what purpose. They were very insistent in asking whether we still had families in France, and where these families were, but we were not so foolish as to tell about our families. He simply said, 'Where is your family, so that we can send you away together.'<note n="19">This feigned solicitousness towards the victims was typical of Nazi deception. Later Henja recounts how upon the arrival of her transport at Auschwitz, the SS asked those who were old or weak to board trucks which would take them into the camp so they wouldn't have to walk. The trucks went straight to the gas chambers. It is unclear who the "he" to whom Henja refers might be.</note></u>

We were lined up five abreast, men on the one side, women on the other side. German officers, with a stick in hand, with savage outcries which were for us still new, started dividing us up, one to the right, one to the left, whichever way it would occur to them. 'Leave your bundles here; you will return presently. We will just count you up.' We left our packages, women were separated from men, sisters from brothers, women to one side, and the men away to the other side. They then started what was called a selection. They asked us who were tired, and they told these to step into the trucks which were waiting. They also told us that the old people shouldn't exert themselves by walking on foot, and that they should mount the trucks and they would be driven to the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>, and the young ones should walk. [The next sentence is not clear.] Out of a transport of fifteen hundred people, men, women, and children--a large number were children--we came into the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> two hundred and fifty French girls and women, and the rest climbed into the trucks, the rest of the women and the older men, also the sick, and they told us the trucks go to a second lager. The men were handled the same way as we were when we started our march to the lager. Now we enter. German soldiers lead us. We assemble on a large square--empty, not a tree grows, not a living human being outside--only Germans. And yelling, 'Fast!' and 'Move on!' The words that we already knew well. We looked at each other--to speak was prohibited--and we see that we are already trapped good. When one enters the lager at the gates, there are flowers, beautiful flowers indeed. And the windows are adorned with very beautiful curtains, and you know what these curtains were--Thalsisin [prayer shawls]--Jewish prayer shawls for curtains.<note n="23">Prayer shawl in Hebrew is Tallit; pl. Tallitot.</note> I stared at it--my father used to pray every day--and I was thinking, 'How is it that we see a Thaleis, a Jewish Thaleis on these windows--hung up there?' And that meant a lot. The hanging of the prayer shawls meant a lot. We were moved into a barracks, we were locked up for all night with no food, no drink. We didn't have anymore our things. They called in girls from the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>, Slovakian girls, Jewish, and they started first of all to take off our "fingers" the golden things that one had, watches, engagement rings--all that was taken off. </u>

Why wasn't it very strict? Because they knew that in <placeName ref="Auschwitz concentration camp" type="camp">Oświęcim</placeName> they would be taken away. And immediately they started to tattoo us. That means to write the number on our hands. Many fainted. I personally revived three of my acquaintances. With a pen they wrote the numbers on our hands with a special ink--the number which I still have today, first, because it won't come off, and second, because I don't want to remove it.<note n="24">Henja's decision not to remove the tattoo on her left arm was prompted by her desire to bear witness to what she had endured and to remind the world of the evils of Nazism.

One German woman was with us in the barracks, and she said that we would have to manage this night, and tomorrow we would go into our barracks.

And we hear music. A march of death--exactly a march of death. We see how men are beaten, and people scream, and men fall, --one cannot call them men. They had no more the appearance of men.

Naked men worked in the zaune, prisoners, and in front of the German men and women undressed, naked, and left their things. From above a man and two or three of them looked at us; our eyes were fixed on the earth, and we could not believe what was happening. First of all, we were taken to the shearing room. Again Slovakian girls--why Slovakians?

There is where all the people went, on the trucks!' We remained standing. We thought she was out of her mind. But from one after another we heard the same story. All who climbed into the trucks are in the crematories. An hour later they showed us a fire which rose from the chimneys. Those are the bodies which burned, they gave us to understand. These old prisoners. And that we could see. We saw it burning, burning intensely. We felt the smell of skin, living skin. We are in the "zaune," in the shearing room. They shear off our hair.

What am I laughing about? I laugh because I can't believe. I laugh because it appears to me that I am not alive, that I am dreaming, that this is a nightmare, that this is not true. And that is only the first day. The hair off--under the shower. A cold, horrible shower. No soap. That coarse German woman, that prostitute, stands and yells, and if one doesn't wash herself fast enough, a blow with a stick. The shower is over. After the shower to dress. We are given trousers. Man's trousers and men's shirts. Worn, dirty. We are also given men's underclothes. There were girls who were menstruating. They did not pay attention to it. Under the cold shower, they were given no things, and so they remained. There is no need to describe how they look. Dressed in rags, and tatters, and these were clothes of Russian prisoners. We even found buttons on these clothes with the hammer and sickle. A kerchief to hide the hair that was absent, and we go to the bureau. The Germans register us.

However, the information was under-reported and considered exaggerated by many. The Polish government in exile in London had included Auschwitz in a list of camps where Nazi atrocities were taking place in July 1942, and a Polish resistance message in March 1943 mentioned Auschwitz as one of the camps where Jews were being killed. The western Allies obtained definitive information about the camp as a result of the April 1944 escape of two prisoners, Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler. Knowledge of the mass exterminations at Auschwitz prompted a number of successful protests to Admiral Horthy, head of the Hungarian government, to halt transports of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz in July 1944. However, the call for the bombing of the camp was rejected by the Allies, who would not even consider the possibility. The passionate debate about whether or not Auschwitz should have been bombed continues, but apart from the question of whether or not it would have succeeded, an attempt to bomb the gas chambers or the railroad lines leading to Auschwitz would have made a significant moral statement.</note> People don't want to believe.

I can't. There I saw around me corpses. Girls with tortured faces. Constantly screaming. I did not believe then that I would ever live among people again. I thought that I had fallen into a different world. Completely different world. In my disordered thoughts, I reasoned, maybe, there is more than one world, a world where one lives normally, but that possibly there is also another world, where life is entirely different, and in such a life people also do live. I thought so then because I believed that one could not stand it, that one could not live through <placeName ref="Auschwitz concentration camp" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName>. But I had to live through, I must live through to be able to come back and tell to the world what I have seen. I have returned, but to tell it is not so easy. Mornings we were going to work. I will give you now an account of the work. I will tell you what kind of work we did. We got up at four o'clock in the morning. It was dark and cold. At night we couldn't sleep, because we slept eight or ten people on one bed that was four meters wide and four meters long. I don't speak about the food, because we were getting a little piece of black bread of about 200 grams [half a pound] for the whole day. Lice, vermin, as they say in French--were crawling over us as if we were prisoners already a long, long, time.

In the year 1943 it wasn't called anymore an extermination camp, but a work camp, and the slogan of the Germans was "work makes free." Our slogan was "Work makes free in the crematories two and three." And our slogan was most correct. As I have already said, we got up at four o'clock in the morning. And that day it was raining. Right the first day we were sent to work. For two hours we were standing for the count-<term ref="#vothG_appell">Appell</term>. That means until six o'clock. Five abreast and a <term ref="#vothG_capo">capo</term>, a German again, a German prostitute.

One company leader, that is, a German soldier, got out of formation and marched among us, leading us straight. 'Left'...just like soldiers so we shouldn't forget to step first with the left foot and all together. Many women didn't know what it means, 'left'. They were mother of children, and all at once they had become soldiers and did not know 'left'. They paid dearly for it. The punishment was a bad beating. Everyone wanted to march inside the formation, because on the sides one would be exposed to blows. In front one was responsible for the stop. We had to walk very fast. Inside the formation one could escape the blows. The mud was deep and heavy. The terrain was as if made to order for a <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>. It was pouring rain, and one could not drag his legs out of the ground. One was unable to walk, especially with those shoes, which were too large. How many kilometers we marched I don't know. About the beatings we were given, about the girls and women, well, I don't have to tell you. People fell, stepped one over the other; there was no time to turn around. It was pouring. The chimneys were on fire at the same time. A German was yelling. Some of us were weeping. They couldn't walk. The shoes were too large, and they fell. What can one do? What should on do? We arrived. I think we walked eight kilometers through a big field. We were ordered to take off our shoes. You know what for? We should not wear out the shoes. We took off our shoes. We were ordered to step into the water. There was a pond, with dirty water. There was a pond, and we had to go into the water up to the head and lift weeds out of the water. What they needed those for I don't know. It really wasn't any work. It was ordered simply to torture us.<note n="26">The kind of work Henja describes was indeed often used at Auschwitz to torture the prisoners and weaken their will to resist by breaking their spirit.

The exhausting work, starvation diet, painfully long Appels and other sadistic acts resulted in feelings of helplessness and hopelessness and turned many prisoners into muselmanner, the living dead. Nevertheless, there were prisoners like Henja who, despite illness, exhaustion, and deprivation, managed to survive through solidarity with others, living one moment at a time, and luck.</note></u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="6758.345" end="x">Were the children with them?</u>
                    <u who="#frydmanH" start="6760.407" end="x">No, the children either remained in France, if they managed to hide them, or the children were brought to the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> and there perished in the gas,[Footnote: The custom to use the word gas to designate the gas chambers, or gas-killings (German--vergasung) is likely to cause the unaccustomed listener some incidents of discomfort. The word gas means in Yiddish and in colloquial German a "street" (Gasse), the "outdoors." Gehen in gas under ordinary circumstances means: to go out, to take a walk, to look for incidental business to panhandle. It was therefore somewhat difficult to get into the habit of associating the words gehen in gas with their new connotation--to die in the gas chambers. This was especially difficult because the interviewees pronounced the expression with so much fluency and matter-of-factness that it really sounded like they would say "he just stepped out", or "they are out for a walk".] because children were separated from the mother, and they were sent into the gas. [A long pause.] We spoke very little. We were very tired, and we were talking about how it was possible for such things to happen. One is beaten, one starved, people being gassed. We remembered a song that we sang in <placeName ref="Drancy concentration camp" type="camp">Drancy</placeName>, that was a song that came from <placeName ref="Dachau concentration camp" type="camp">Dachau</placeName>, which was composed by the first prisoners of <placeName ref="Dachau concentration camp" type="camp">Dachau</placeName>, and this song was very well suited to the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>. </u>

                    <u who="#frydmanH" start="6836.810" end="x">French. That was translated from the German.

You only hear the steps of the Germans and the rattle of the arms, and only crying and weeping, and no song comes from the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>.' That song indeed described the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>. The tune itself was a good description. It is a very sad tune. We sang that song, and so passed the day.</u>

                    <u who="#frydmanH" start="6961.358" end="x">These two verses told a lot. 'Death to the one who tries to escape.' And so it was. Not only death to the one who tries to escape, run away, but death to all those who are there. Now I shall start the chapter, the general chapter about the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>. By that I mean, about the psychology of the Germans. Why and how they have led people to the state in which we found ourselves. First of all, they made Jews, old prisoners, responsible for the management of a <term ref="#vothG_block">block</term>. They made the Jewish physicians, the doctors, responsible for selecting the sick from the hospital--because afterward there was a hospital--and sending them into the gas. They made Jews responsible for management of the work. They [the Germans] only had to receive their reports and to see to it that their orders were complied with. And that is why we saw Jews beating Jews, and that is why we hear now that bandits have come out of the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>. That is, the Germans have made bandits out of the Jews. They led them into a situation in which they had no time to think. There was no such thing among us as thinking. We did not think. I don't say. I personally was fortunate not to have any responsibilities. I was just a common prisoner. I was not hated like the prisoners who had responsible positions. A Jew would beat a Jew, because Germans were strict, and the German would beat the Jew who did not want to beat another Jew. Jews worked in the crematories, which means that Jews have been burning their own kindred, because the first day when they came to the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> they would be assigned to such positions, and the Germans looked on, and ordered them to start fires and to burn.<note n="29">The SS employed a system of "prisoner self-administration" throughout the camp system. Yet one should be cautious in stereotyping the Jews who served as capos and in other responsible positions in Auschwitz. Many acted in the way Henja describes. They were cruel and ruthless. Yet there were some who sought in various ways to alleviate the plight of the prisoners and engage in different forms of clandestine resistance.</note></u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="7223.562" end="x">Of course, they burned only the bodies.</u>
                    <u who="#frydmanH" start="7226.234" end="x">They burned the bodies, yes. They burned the bodies because, before the people went through the gas chambers, they told the people that they were going bathing, that they were going to take a shower. And these gas chambers, according to a report from a friend I have who worked there, looked exactly like a shower bath. Little holes for the water to come through, but instead of water would come through gas. And in this way the people were destroyed. And from there to the crematories, like into a bakery. The system went like this. There was room in the furnace for three people, a stout one, a thin one, and a very thin one. And those three people were shoved in, and they burned. And so the crematories were arranged. They were in <placeName ref="Birkenau concentration camp" type="camp">Birkenau</placeName>, six crematories, which have been working day and night with interruption.<note n="30">In Birkenau, there were four crematoria which had the capacity to burn 4,416 bodies on a daily basis.</note> [Pause]. I shall not continue in order. I shall speak about the things that pass now through my thoughts. I was in Krankenburg. That is, the hospital--one may call it a "hospital". I was sick with typhus, spotted typhus, and pneumonia in addition. I was for three months in a hospital. You may ask why I was three months in a hospital. Well, they did nothing to heal us. I survived the three months of the hospital just due to my character. I was not far from death. I did not look like a human being anymore. Only my thoughts were still human. I was thinking about getting away. My fever was 40-41 degress C. It wasn't possible to stand it. All at once the Germans came in and ordered that the whole hospital be sent into the gas, all the sick. They said that otherwise we might infect the whole <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>; and we were registered, and we were expecting that trucks will come to take us to the gas. I thought that I would not let them take me into the gas. I had in the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> a girl friend whose name was Molly Zinnenbaum [??], from Belgium. She was a messenger.<note n="31">"Molly Zinnenbaum" is actually Mala Zimetbaum, an Auschwitz heroine, who at the age of twenty arrived in Auschwitz in 1942 on a transport of Jews from Belgium. Mala became a courier and an interpreter in the camp due to her fluency in several languages. As Henja's experiences illustrate, Mala, despite the risks, went to great lengths to help fellow prisoners. Mala met a Polish prisoner named Adek Galinski, and the two fell in love. With the help of the camp underground the pair escaped in June 1944. Mala was the first woman to successfully do so. However, they were recaptured and returned to the camp. Henja relates what occurred to Mala subsequently. Adek also died defiantly. What role Mala played in securing Henja's position as a "nurse" in the camp "hospital" is not stated. This indoor job was another factor in Henja's survival</note></u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="7439.755" end="x">A what?</u>
                    <u who="#frydmanH" start="7440.723" end="x">A messenger. That is, she had a good job in the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>, which consisted of making lists of the people in the hospital who should go to work in the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>. She was in contact with the woman <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> manager, the German, and she did a lot for us, and she saved me from the gas. She said that I was her cousin, and that if I am being sent to the gas, she should be, also. And since the Germans needed her in their work, I was excluded from the list, and I was out of that. There followed two or three more of such moments, and the same Molly saved me. The same Molly was shot in <placeName ref="Birkenau concentration camp" type="camp">Birkenau</placeName> in the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> where I was because she escaped from the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>.

She was many times taken out of that bunker and interrogated. I cannot tell you exactly her story about her stay in the bunker, because we had no more opportunity to talk to Molly. She had no more contact with us. We found out the same day that she was caught, and soon she was returned to the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>. And it was as I told you before. We were assembled together after work in the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> to see what can happen to a human being who displeases the Germans. The woman <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> leader made a speech, and in this speech she told us that the prisoners who applied themselves to their work were being well treated by the Germans. But those who betray the Germans--there are no words, it means treason [??]. But Molly did, and we all knew what was awaiting her. Present were the work service of the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> commander, and the whole top authority of the Germans. After the speech Molly was to be executed. The work service leaders approached Molly and wanted to tie her hands. And all at once one sees that blood is flowing from Molly. What has happened? Molly knew what was in store for her. She provided herself with a razor blade and the moment when the Germans wanted to hang her she cut her arteries on the hands.</u>

                    <u who="#frydmanH" start="x" end="x">This was found in the division which received the people upon their arrival, their things; and among the things it happened that one of them recognized me and showed me that picture.<note n="35">Henja is speaking about a section of the camp known as "Canada" where some 600 female prisoners sorted the belongings stolen from those arriving at  the camp. Though all the valuables were supposedly the property of the Reich, SS men regularly stole items from "Canada," thus personally profiting from them.

                    <u who="#frydmanH" start="x" end="x">And he remained together with them. My parents hoped, I believe, all through their journey, to see their daughter. But it did not happen that way.</u>

                    <u who="#frydmanH" start="x" end="x">I was one of the first Jewish deportees from France who returned, and upon my arrival there was already formed a union of Jewish deportees.</u>

                    <u who="#boderD" start="x" end="x">Is this a job? Do you earn something?</u>
                    <u who="#frydmanH" start="x" end="x">Yes. I am getting 6,000 francs a month as a secretary. [At the black market rate this was about $30.00 a month.] As a secretary I work ordinarily just like any other secretary, but my work, or course, isn't like in any ordinary office.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="x" end="x">Yes.</u>
                    <u who="#frydmanH" start="x" end="x">But I work here because it gives me something to do.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="x" end="x">Can you live on 6,000 francs?</u>
                    <u who="#frydmanH" start="x" end="x">No, one cannot live on 6,000 francs, but still one lives on what he has. Many people in France do not earn more than I do, and they live. One adapts himself to any conditions. It is not hard for me, because anything is good for me, because now I have liberty. Of course, it isn't what I expected, because I returned and there was no home; there are no parents. My brothers, whom I loved dearly, are no more. So life doesn't mean much now. I often wonder why I got out, and why they remained there. But one should not talk; it doesn't help. Everyone understands what it does to a person's heart to lose his parents in such tragic times, because we know that when a person dies his own death, nothing can be done. That is a matter of nature. But when one knows that the parents have gone into gas, that is very hard; it is very hard to bear such a thought.<note n="36">As Henja notes, liberation for the survivors was bittersweet. They regained their liberty but were forever scarred by their painful experiences and losses. Like so many others, Henja experienced survivor guilt, questioning why she survived while so many others perished.</note></u>

I should like to go to see them, but to remain there--I do not believe so. I have started life here. I do not feel anymore like traveling around and wandering around. My ideal has remained the same, to fight against Fascism, together with all those who were tortured up to now, the Spanish, the Jews, and many other peoples, because we are not the only people who suffered.

He survived the murderous Stalinist purge of Jewish artists during the "Black Years" of 1948-1953, though he never forsook his Jewish identity.
