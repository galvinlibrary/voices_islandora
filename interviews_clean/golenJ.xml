I am really overstaying my time [intelligible?] and they can't send me one anyway before . . . eight o'clock tonight. I am . . . it is Rosh Hashanah and the Jewish community is in the synagogue—the synagogue which I've been told has not yet been officially dedicated but has of course Rosh Hashanah services in . . . after the chaplain has said . . . what's the chaplain's name?</u>

I am taking time out. I am tempted to go over there and take part in the services later but I'm taking time out since I have here with me Mr. Judah Golen, a representative of the Jewish agency of Palestine,—for Palestine—and since I have met a number of these men and women . . . often in Italy and France on railroad trains and so on . . . I have decided to take out this morning out and he has graciously agreed to tell us something about the work of the representatives of the Jewish Agency for Palestine which, according to him, has about a hundred people working in the various <term ref="#vothG_dp">DP</term> camps. Also, Mr. Golen, would you be so kind first of all to tell who you are and then let's go on with the story. The microphone is yours for as much time as you want.</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="98.948" end="x">Well, um, I myself am a Palestinian. Born in Palestine, <placeName ref="Yerushalayim">Jerusalem</placeName>; the son of parents who were born in Palestine—and the grandson of grandfather and grandmother who were born in Palestine.

I have volunteered a few months ago to go to Europe and see what one can do for the remnants of the Jews who are still in Europe. My object is really to be in Austria and establish there the connections, and the machinery, for dealing with the Jews who are there and who are passing from Eastern Europe to the Western side with an idea to come later to Palestine.</u>

I'm going to have a small mission of some fifteen men and women from Palestine who would be spread all over Austria to the various camps—in the various camps—and do first of all the cultural and instructive work among the <term ref="#vothG_dp">DPs</term>. The, um, to tell you how the whole thing started it would be a rather a long story but the first . . . Jews who arrived in Europe during the war and immediately after . . . victory were the Jews from Palestine who served in the Jewish brigades which is now known all over the world. They were the first who reached the remnants of our brothers and succeeded in getting to a far point in—within Russia itself. They then organized and helped those Jews to come over to the Allies and . . . rather Western side of Europe. Would you stop the . . .</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="262.858" end="x">Now, uh, after the Jewish brigade had to leave Europe and go back to Palestine for demobilization the Jewish Agency for Palestine decided to send a number of Jewish shluchim which called really "messengers" from Palestine to the Jews in Europe. The Jewish Agency has contacted the <term ref="#vothG_unrra">UNRRA</term> . . . <term ref="#vothG_unrra">UNRRA</term> authorities who are very sympathetic and who assisted in having a number of Jews from Palestine come over to Europe. The JAFP—which means the Jewish agency for Palestine is now in Europe—in Germany—as a separate unit attached to the <term ref="#vothG_unrra">UNRRA</term>. There are now about a hundred of such men and women doing work in the various camps, among the <term ref="#vothG_dp">DPs</term> in conjunction with <term ref="#vothG_unrra">UNRRA</term>.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="323.565" end="x">May I ask a question? How is that financially handled?</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="326.445" end="x">Well, the Jewish agency pays their expenses as to if a man has to get his salary for example, he is paid by the Jewish agency. On the other hand the <term ref="#vothG_unrra">UNRRA</term> keeps the men in Germany and covers, as many other members of the <term ref="#vothG_unrra">UNRRA</term>, their economic and traveling expenses. I wouldn't say all traveling expenses—a major part is being paid by the Jewish Agency. But various facilities are sympathetically given by the <term ref="#vothG_unrra">UNRRA</term>. . . . another question?</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="360.917" end="x">No. Go ahead.</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="362.477" end="x">So, the hundred of men and women are spread all over Germany—British and American Zones. As I said I don't want . . . I want to limit myself to my own function.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="373.877" end="x">Yes.</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="374.117" end="x">My immediate object is to leave for <placeName ref="Wien">Vienna</placeName> in a few days and come in contact there with <term ref="#vothG_unrra">UNRRA</term> authorities in <placeName ref="Wien">Vienna</placeName> and Austria so that we can establish a unit of the Jewish Agency in Austria. "What are these men and women from Palestine doing in the camp?" First of all, one should realize the mental and physical situation of the Jews who arrived a few months ago from Poland and who are coming here with strong stream from Poland and even Russia.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="413.718" end="x">Excuse me, when you speak "arrived a few months ago from Poland" you speak about those what the <term ref="#vothG_unrra">UNRRA</term> calls "infiltrees"</u>

                    <u who="#boderD" start="421.908" end="x">Well, are you interested only in the "infiltrees?"</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="423.978" end="x">No, no we are—our men are mainly stationed in the various <term ref="#vothG_dp">DP</term> camps where you have . . .

But as there are Jews from Palestine, they have the ability and possibility to deal in more cultural work for the Jews in the <term ref="#vothG_dp">DP</term>.

                    <u who="#golenJ" start="505.355" end="x">Which is well-known and one of the biggest associations not just in America and all over the world. The connection between the Jewish Agency and the <term ref="#vothG_ajdc">AJDC</term> in Europe is rather strong and as far as I could see from the last two or three weeks I have been in <placeName ref="München">Munich</placeName>—in <placeName ref="München">Munich</placeName>, in Germany—the relations are very good. I have met a great number of <term ref="#vothG_ajdc">AJDC</term> men and <term ref="#vothG_ort">ORT</term> men and I see that in one respect, in respect of helping the brothers—all our own brothers—the men on the [spot?] have understood that is one thing and that is harmony among the workers so that the Jews who are here should only gain by the presence of such an organization. Now . . .</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="554.421" end="x">Mr. Golen I think you have made here an interesting point. There are two schools of thought some people constantly kick that there is duplication—that too many different agencies do the same thing. Just to say personally I want to say right now that I don't agree with that. What do you think?</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="580.356" end="x">Well I associate myself with your view. I don't think there is duplication. 'A:' I consider that there is a lack of men all over. . . . of Jews from more liberated countries like America, Palestine, France, England who can do a great deal for those people who are in the <term ref="#vothG_dp">DPs</term>. But as to the question of duplication I don't consider that duplication. What we, the Jewish Agency, is doing now is "A:" . . . the language which is Jewish and the Hebrew language is common with the Jews who come from Poland. Many, many of those Jews do not know English or any other language in which they could converse with the people who come from America. The Jewish Agency is establishing schools with the aid of the <term ref="#vothG_ajdc">AJDC</term>—the teachers come from Palestine. Some money and other help is being given by the other institutions. The Hebrew language is being taught to the children and other subjects are being taught in Hebrew.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="643.072" end="x">Excuse me another point for interrupting I know it is terrible nuisance. What money is considered? Would you say the money comes exclusively from America?</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="654.022" end="x">Well, I would not say that. Although I would say a great deal of money is coming from America . . .</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="658.702" end="x">But . . .</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="659.092" end="x"> But I, from my own experience in Palestine, I know that they have many collections being organized among the Jewish population who count now about 650,000 in Palestine and I know practically every Jew in Palestine has been contributing to these various Jewish institutions whose object is also—I mean who includes in that program helping the Jews in the Diaspora. I know that during the war the first, I would say, the first who succeeded in sending over help in money and in other ways—I mean in clothing and books and so on to Europe, to the people who were still in the . . . under the enemy regime, were the Palestinians. But I would not say that they did it themselves. It's known and I know it from my own personal knowledge that the <term ref="#vothG_ajdc">AJDC</term> . . . helped a great deal. I mean they really supplied the money and the Jews of Palestine found a way to send it over, with their own money collected from Palestine, to the <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</term> in <placeName ref="Warsaw">Warsaw</placeName> . . . to Poland and to other places in Europe when the Germans were still there.</u>

They would take a Jew from Palestine more into their confidence than any other person. Also the question of the language which is more common between the Palestinian Jew and the Jew from Poland whether it's Yiddish or Hebrew because I see I am really surprised to see a great number of Jews coming from Lithuania, Poland and other countries in Eastern Europe speak fluently Hebrew—speak fluent Hebrew—which is again a sign of attachment to the Jewish people and to Palestine. Would you like to know anything?</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="835.033" end="x">Yes. Well . . . So let us continue about this . . . Let me ask you this question: "In your impression—you mentioned the poor—do all <term ref="#vothG_dp">DPs</term>, all displaced Jews, or all of we couldn't say, but what do you estimate? What percentage of the <term ref="#vothG_dp">DPs</term> and which age groups long for Palestine and which one would want to go to America, South America, Australia, South Africa and other places?" You couldn't say that everyone wants to go to Palestine?</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="867.118" end="x">Well I'll you exactly how it is—I'll tell you. Immediately after the war and during the war, as far as I know in my conversations with various Jews in various camps, Palestine was the only light which really gave them some energy to . . . stand and to wait until victory comes. I admit that there has been some disappointment among many Jews because external difficulties—we cannot ignore the various political difficulties existing in Palestine and outside. The Jews are not the only masters of Palestine and they could not bring over so many Jews as they wanted. But . . . and these difficulties naturally caused the various Jews in Europe to feel bitter at the time against those elements who did not allow them to come to the place where they longed and they thought they belonged. There may be quite a number of Jews who now, after seeing these difficulties, try to find another place to [?] and to have some peace—peace of mind and peace of body. People move for South Africa where they have relatives there, people move for America—especially the United States—I . . . and people certainly move for Palestine. These are I would say apart from—and you may have some Jews who would like to go to Australia. I consider that all those Jews who do want to go to places outside of Palestine are Jews who have some relatives in there and some hope that they would be able to enter a new life in those countries. As far as I see prospects are not very large. Neither America, although America has shown a great—what should I say—great generosity . . . I can't . . . whether this is the word . . . towards accepting Jews into their land. This would not solve the problem because the problem is a matter of, at least now, two hundred thousand Jews who are now in Austria and German zones—not to mention the Jews who are expected here from Poland.</u>

This is, the American zone, is the . . . I would say now the immediate ideal of many Jews to come to because, "A:" the kindness shown by the American authorities literally and civilly is so great that people think they can stay here for a while until they come to a more permanent station. This should be really stressed. The, as far as I could know, from people who were in straight—in direct from connections with the various authorities here, I mean the Americans—the Americans have shown great deal of understanding of the Jewish problems and Jewish difficulties and a great deal of help has been given them physically I would say and spiritually.

Well, as to the question of certificates, for example, the fact that a number of Jews succeeded in getting into Palestine—not waiting for the granting of these certificates they had no patience, they had no power to wait, no strength to wait—these certificates which were supposed to be given to the Jewish Agency were to be deducted on that account so that for the last three months the Jewish agency has not received any certificates for the purpose of bringing over Jews from the . . . Europe. The hope is that the next few weeks the British government will realize the difficulty which is caused to the various Jews in Europe, Jews in Palestine and the Jews all over the world, and will increase the figure to a height which would at least satisfy, in some respect, the amount—great amount—of the Jews asked to come into Palestine.

But we have it in Sweden, we have it in Germany now, in <placeName ref="München">Munich</placeName>, we have it in other towns around the American zone.

As I said, unfortunately, the number of certificates is so small that it's become rather . . . the certificate is less important than anything because of its . . . the difficulty of getting it . . . because of its non-existence, I would say. The Palestinian offices have now almost no work to do. But the Jewish Agency is establishing these Palestinian offices with the hope that certificates would be granted—in a greater number—and then the work would start again. "What are the Palestinian offices doing exactly and how do they give the certificates?" There are various categories: "A:" there are relatives in Palestine like fathers who have their sons in Europe or husbands who have left their wives in Europe—these have the priority. Again, you have sons who have their parents, sisters who have their brothers—these have, again, the priority. After that comes the efficiency of the man. You have the various movements—youth movements—who organize their members in various works, [so it should be?] as I've said before, these <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutzei</term>

And the group goes over to Palestine as a group. There, they are immediately absorbed in one of the settlements so that the economic question is not existing at all. Again you have, before the war we had also a category of "capitalists." That we, as Jews who owned over a thousand pounds, were allowed to be given—were allowed to come to Palestine under such certificate. These were also distributed in conjunction with the Jewish Agency. But government itself—British government—could also give certificates for people without even consulting the Jewish Agency (as to this question of these capitalists).

So that they, at the time when the certificates are available, they take into consideration the immediate necessity of the number of certificates needed to a certain place. If, for example, during the war, there was hope to help and to save Jews from Rumania they then sent a greater number of certificates to Rumania at that time.

For example, according to the law—the immigration law in Palestine—I would say persons mentally unfit would not be able—are not allowed to come into Palestine. But, Palestine has absorbed a great number of people who are invalids as a result of the war and who are—who have become weak in health as a result of the war. On the contrary, they are even given more consideration and are being helped more in social . . . in a social respect than those who don't need this help. I know, for example, being myself in Haifa when a boat of . . . arrived. Most of the people were really physically not well. This is not because . . . this was only as a result of the war.

                    <u who="#golenJ" start="2195.354" end="x">No there is not such question of "more favored." The Jewish Agency for Palestine consists of all the Jews who are interested in Palestine. In the Jewish Agency you have members . . .

I would say the Labor party who are also orthodox you have [Hapo'el Hamizrachi?]. And when certificates are available, considerations are being made by the executives consisting of these various members and every group whether religious or not religious would receive the share they deserve (as to their numbers in young men as well as ability in other fields of activity).</u>

I was in Italy . . . they have there self-government. I saw in one room 36 young people. Men and women together, well that is common for all <term ref="#vothG_unrra">UNRRA</term> camps. They let the Mennonites who seem to be the best organized live men, women, and children together in one barrack. It is not particular to the Jews but it seems to have been . . . and it is not on their fault, so to say, but let me ask you this question . . . Now let's come back and take that what hurts us most: thirty-six young people in one room. Married couples when they are without children also in that same room. Sometimes the cots moved together, sometimes two people in one cot. Of course it's all better than it was in the German concentration camp but "what do you think is the influence and the significance of such life?" "And what can be done in general about it?"</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="2441.092" end="x">Well, if I understand your question correctly, you ask "why are men and women—thirty-six young boys and girls—living together in the same room?"

There is no such thing as living families in the same room together. No human being likes that—it's against human nature—and these young boys and girls if they do conduct a life together in—as you saw, said you saw in Italy—I can assure you, even without my having been there, that it's out of difficulty to sheer necessity to get separate rooms. The idea of the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term>, of the collective . . . life in the collective form, is not—is not to eliminate and forget the individual element.

No. Only when he comes home and if he still has, even though let's say if the woman works—if the woman has to prepare food and to do other things, she has no time to give to her child. While in the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> the child is being taken care [of] by special nurses, or I call them "mothers" because they are members of the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> who have their own children and the other children in these children houses.

I would say as I've said before that these family ties, the connection between the parent and the child in the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> is stronger because the father has time and has the possibility to give his time to the.. to his son.

Certainly if she wants to be near her child she can take a job at the maternity house or at the baby's house and take care of her own child and the other children. But the confidence of the mothers in their own friends in their women-friends is so strong that no mother would worry about her child if it's being taken care of by a friend of hers.

                    <u who="#golenJ" start="3703.525" end="x">No doubt about that. A member can have a camera which is valued more than even a car sometimes—it's his own property. And nobody will ask him how he got it or "why doesn't he give it to the use of the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term>?" Usually a member who has something which can serve for the purpose of the whole community—public opinion would make him so that he should really give it.

                    <u who="#boderD" start="3743.961" end="x">. . . and I feel a lot of heckling and a lot of questioning. Let's take this: Suppose a member of the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> has a watch to repair and an other member of the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> has learned in the art of somewhere watch-making, repairs it for him. Can one pay to the other privately for it?</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="3761.113" end="x">No. There's no such thing as money as I said and members do not have money. But, if a member has a watch and he has to repair it, the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> will pay for repairing that watch either in town or in the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term>. That means if a man knows the work of watch-repairing or watch-making in the kibbutz, he will not be paid, it will be his profession and he gets for the work he does his food and his clothing and his health service and he's being taken care of by the various people around—he should have been taken care of—for that he gives his work, whatever he can do whether its watch-making or whether its another way. He will not pay his friend. "A:" his friend will not ask for money, "B:" the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> is responsible to the watch to run smoothly and they will pay for the repairing expenses.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="3810.809" end="x">A-ha. Now let me tell you, the executives of the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term>, do they get paid?</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="3816.389" end="x">No. There is no such thing as "paid" at all in the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term>. The <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> as a whole is paid with the outside market—if they sell their goods or their food, they get money. For this money the committee buys things for the members of the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term>. And they get it directly without having money pass through the hands of each individual. There is no need for money because you can do nothing for money. If he goes to town, he is being given an amount sufficient to . . . have him . . . to make him able to spend a fortnight or three weeks in town. Usually members of the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> have their leave once a year for a fortnight or three weeks . . .</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="3855.751" end="x">Uh-huh.</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="3856.407" end="x">At that time they are given . . . being given money, they are given money to spend in town if they want to spend their time in town and for traveling expenses and so on. But generally, people of the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> as I said do not have money because they don't need any money; they have all their necessities supplied by the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term>.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="3874.736" end="x">Now let's have this point more: the products of the . . . excuse me . . . the products of the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> are being sold on the open market, the proceeds are coming into the management of the kibbutz, and they then with the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term>—this management of the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term>—decide how these products should be distributed.</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="3893.822" end="x">That's right.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="3894.115" end="x">Well, is there any special reward for the more efficient worker against the less efficient worker?</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="3899.604" end="x">No. No such thing as a "special reward." More efficient workers are glad to give their efficiency to the whole community.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="3911.680" end="x">Well, what do you do against loafing—against the tendency to be a parasite . . . not to work?</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="3916.988" end="x">There is no such thing as "parasite" because, as I said there is no law and order but there is a public opinion in the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> which would not let a member sit in doing nothing. The moment he spends a day . . . he wastes a day . . . nobody will tell him a word, nobody will say anything. Certainly if he says "I don't want to go out to work"—public opinion would be so . . . I would say . . . depressing upon him, pressing upon him, that he will not be able to stay in the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> more . . . to stay in the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> more than a day or two and leave it if he wants to be a parasite. But as I said members who prove their attachment to the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> after a year of trial would remain in such a <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> if not, they would leave of their own will.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="3964.449" end="x">So there wouldn't be, you see I am talking for instance like a personnel-man. I know that for instance when civil-service employees are allowed thirty days leave and thirty days for sickness they manage to be sick those thirty days in the year. [laughing]</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="3984.057" end="x">Oh, well, no such thing would be in the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> as I said, public opinion and collective spirits of the people . . . because if a man doesn't want to work his place is to go perhaps to in town—to town. Public opinion would not allow a member—and as I said only public opinion—there's no such thing as rule, there's no such thing as thing as punishment, no such thing as fine and there's no such thing as requesting openly from a member to do his job. Public opinion is the ruling power and I would say, the moving spirit of the whole running of the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term>. And a member would not be able to see around him working men while he does nothing. He will have to do a job. If he is sick then it is the duty of the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> to take care of him, even if he is sick for more than a month or two months. I know members who stayed in a <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> two years and they unfortunately became ill, they got TB as a . . . from some . . . result or another and they are being taken care of for years without doing any work. The <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> pays thousands of pounds a month for members to be cured in some resort or some other place; in Palestine or outside. I know even of members who have been sent to Switzerland to be cured at the expense of the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term>. Members who stayed in the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> only two or three months but who proved their desire to work in the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> and the <term ref="#vothG_kibbutz">kibbutz</term> feels it's a duty to take care of its members.</u>

The first who established it was Joseph Trumpeldor who was killed in the north of Palestine by Arabs at the time. He came up with the idea that Jews cannot and should not rely on others especially when such others are not existent or when such others are not wishing to help. They should rely on themselves.

                    <u who="#boderD" start="4396.159" end="x">Here is a question—rather a maybe leading question. A few weeks ago in a British paper I saw a quarter-of-a-page ad to trying to recruit soldiers for the service in Palestine. It had a headline: "It is a man's job."</u>

                    <u who="#golenJ" start="4420.784" end="x">Well it seems that the politics are not always as they say . . . everywhere and are not always to be understood so swiftly and directly. If the British have some interest in Palestine they would—in order to carry out such interest, in order to come to the object of what they have they would recruit people who they think would serve their own purpose better. You ask "why don't they recruit Jews—the Jewish people in Palestine—for that purpose?" The question is what is the purpose? At wartime when there was the war they tried to recruit as many Jews as they were able to—to put them to the front. And many, many Jews—over thirty-five thousand Jews joined the British Army and fought in all fields—in Europe, in North Africa, Syria and other places. Now, if the British authorities try to recruit men—it means to, they think, to keep order in the Middle East and they would certainly like to have British people more than Jewish people from Palestine.</u>

                    <u who="#golenJ" start="4629.963" end="x">The word haganah itself means defense—self defense. The Jews in Palestine, as I've said before—after having experienced so many atrocities all over the world, all over history, have decided to be in some respect the masters of their own life and in this respect they have organized without even any . . . instigation on the part of any leadership but within themselves they have organized themselves into a defense force. This defense force is comprised of practically every Jew who is able to give a hand in the defense machinery. Their object is certainly not aggressive—it has never been aggressive—they have proved their . . . the right of their existence in the various riots which took place since they have tried to come back to Palestine. They never meant to take anything away from others by force—whether it's land, whether it's property, whether it's any other right or ownership. What the thing is . . . the idea is to keep whatever they have got for themselves and not to allow others to take it away which we have seen in so many—so many times to have been carried out. The haganah has been appearing in the various [press?] and has been heard all over the world as a result of the last act being carried out in Palestine. One should distinguish the haganah from any other terrorist or from any terrorist organization. The haganah it would not be justified it would be entirely incorrect to call the haganah a 'terrorist organization.' It's true, there are some . . . there are two organizations who would be . . . would consider themselves . . . terrorists in the sense of attacking British property or rather Palestinian government property. These are young men who experienced hardships out of Palestine, who psychologically were badly influenced as a result of what had gone over . . . what has passed from themselves and from their parents. Young men who lost their families and who hoped to be able to establish themselves in Palestine after experience . . . experiencing so many disappointments as a result of political difficulties they have gone over to accuse the British in that and from the point of accusing they have also tried to carry out certain terrorist acts as I said, destroying property of the British. They are not in the sense of—there are differences even between themselves—but they are not under any Jewish organization or Jewish authority. And the Jewish institutions openly and sincerely oppose to such and undisciplined, and I would say unwise, acts being carried out by these young men.</u>

You think there is a possibility of peaceful . . . living and understanding between the Jews and the Arabs even if the immigration should be raised, say, by about two-hundred thousand souls [?] in the next few years?</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="4894.496" end="x">I as a Jew consider that there is ample opportunity and possibility of having peace in Palestine—only and . . . only if the Jews are given the right to come to Palestine. I would say the Arab nation as a whole is not so much afraid of the Jews who want to come to Palestine as it's being tried to be . . . as people try to show it. It's true that there are a number of Arab leaders who consider it their duty to arise within the Arab population such fears but from experience till now we know that the more the Jews—the more Jews arrive in Palestine the better off were the Arabs in Palestine, economically—and not only economically—socially, politically, and many other respects. One thing should be clear, clearly told. Palestine is not and cannot be a country for one nation only. Palestine was the cradle of three religions, Palestine is the land of many nations, and Palestine originated . . . [?] origin the Jewish people and various other nations. It cannot be the land of one nation. This has also been establish by the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. In this sense what the Arabs say that "no Jew has any right to this country called Palestine" is, I would say, a mistake and a historical mistake. The Jews say that they cannot—they will never displace any Arabs from their country but to that I would like to add that every Jew has a right to this country as long as no Arab is being displaced and the intention of the Jews is to come to Palestine and develop the country in such a way that would let both people live peacefully . . . each at the side of the other.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="5033.914" end="x">By "developing" you mean they will reclaim a narrow fruitless land [themselves?]?</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="5039.222" end="x">They have . . . certainly. Palestine is a neglected country. It has been neglected for the last few hundred years. History shows us that Palestine used to be a most . . . one of the most fruitful countries in the Middle East. It had millions of population about two thousand years ago. And with energy, finance, work, and strong rule Palestine can return to its original situation. The Jews who have come to Palestine during the last fifty years have mainly developed neglected land. Such land as can be found. The Jews own now only six percent of the land of the country. So you have another 96 . . . 94%. Out of that you have some land belonging to the Arabs, developed by them, more extensively than the Jewish development but in addition to that you have large tracts of land entirely neglected. You have almost half the size of Palestine which is called the Negev—the southern part which is now a desert. The Jews claim it and they hope to be able to reclaim it. That means to develop the land, to plant there, they have already a few stations there—kind of an experimenting station . . . where they try to find water by all means—scientific means—in their hands. And they have proved already a success. In the middle of the desert down south of Palestine near the Sinai, near the [?] you have Jewish settlements where no person thought of any possibility to plant trees there and to sew crops there. Now they are gathering the fruit very happily. We have remnants of old towns in the times of the Crusades there, which shows that this desert was once inhabited. What we want is to inhabit those neglected settlements again without affecting in any way the people who are already in Palestine.</u>

                    <u who="#boderD" start="5254.616" end="x">By liberally you mean "religious tolerance" or "a great deal of religion?"</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="5258.867" end="x">Well, I mean religious tolerance and a great deal of religion in certain settlements. You have settlements where all the group is religious that means Jews who belong to the party of the Mizrachi and who also adopted the idea of collectivism—of having a settlement and running their lives in the same way and form as the other settlements.</u>

                    <u who="#boderD" start="5286.605" end="x">Pardon my ignorance.</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="5288.529" end="x">Mizrachi is one of the political parties of the <term ref="#vothG_zionist">Zionist</term> organization—of the Jewish Agency, if you want to say. It's rather the <term ref="#vothG_zionist">Zionist</term> organization—there are Jews all over the world—religious Jews who could consider that they have to combine work and religion in the . . . with the view of "up-building" the country—of Palestine. And these younger boys of the Mizrachi have established settlements—religious settlements—that means where they can practice their religion and they can carry on with their work without any body interrupting them. When I say without any body interrupting them it doesn't mean in other settlements religion is being interrupted. On the contrary—in every settlement, practically every settlement, you have a shul—a synagogue—where all the parents go to pray and where the younger people whoever want, can go and pray. Religion is being taught in schools—in the settlements—Bible and other Jewish, religious . . . learning. But it is free, nobody would force you to be religious but nobody would be sad you [can't be?] religious.</u>

                    <u who="#golenJ" start="5365.015" end="x">The same as you would do in any place of Palestine or any other place in the world. Any person who is not religious is allowed to do whatever he likes but on one condition—not to rouse—not to rise any bad feelings on another person. That means not to cause a religious person any suffering. No [?], what you call—no "open smoking" should be practiced where there are religious Jews. And in the religious settlements, certainly, there is no question of smoking on Saturday because they keep Sabbath fully and to the last point. But even in town Jews . . . I can't say that the Jews wouldn't smoke on Shabbat—they will smoke on Shabbat but they would see to it that none smoke it or rather that religious Jews should not see it.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="5416.521" end="x">Well, wouldn't you consider that it's about time to start a movement of tolerance and teach those Jews to respect the religious views of other Jews?</u>
                    <u who="#golenJ" start="5427.237" end="x">No doubt about that. I think that Palestine in this respect has shown a great deal of tolerance. On the one part the religious Jews understand that they cannot make every Jew religious by force, they are trying to preach—to induce opportunity to be more religious, but they don't use force. There is a small force of younger, fanatic religious Jews who try to interrupt the traffic on the eve of Shabbat but they are really a very negligible part of the whole and really can't be taken into consideration.
