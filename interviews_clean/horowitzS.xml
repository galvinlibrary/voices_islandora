Thanks to their initiative, their help in every sphere, that really strengthened the broken up, surviving Jews of the Shaarith Haplatim, and this gives them the possibility of existing anew and to begin living anew. But I want to tell our American brothers, they should know that the aid that they are giving is really very big. The aid is very important. But an adjustment we have not achieved yet.

                    <p>Note 3 for page - 47 - (2033): The section [Sedra] Ki Tetzay covers a portion of Deuteronomy beginning with verse 10, chapter 21, and concluding with the last verse of chapter 25. Although this section extensively preaches the most humane treatment of stranges 'within thy gates,' it does not contain the quotation to which the interviewee refers. This quotation is not to be found in the section [Sedra] Kedoshim, and twice in the same chapter 19 of Liviticus: once, verse 18, in the exact wording of the interviewee, and again in a slightly different wording, but with direct reference to 'the stranger that sojourneth with you,' in verse 34. In the New Testament the proper quotation in the exact wording of the interviewee will be found in Mathew 22:39. These references may, of course, be found by checking with any Concordance, however, the writer feels that he is in good company when he confesses that up to this interview he had but little motivation to clear up this matter for himself, and that the query arose in the interview as a consequence of Rabbi Horowitz's statement. —D.P.B.</p>

A victim of a catastrophe may not always be its best historian, but his reports, like items of folklore, give a definite portrayal of moods, and may render valuable leads for historical, anthropological, and psychological follow-ups. —D.B.P.</p>
