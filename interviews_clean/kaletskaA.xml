                    <u who="#boderD" start="122.337" end="x">And where were you when the Germans came to Poland?</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="127.165" end="x">In 1939, September 1st, I was still with my parents together in <placeName ref="Kielce">Kielce</placeName>. My father was an important citizen in <placeName ref="Kielce">Kielce</placeName> for about thirty-five years. Together with us on the night of Friday- from Thursday to Friday it was- there happened to be with us my brother from Potianice and a child of my oldest sister, a grandchild twelve years old. At six o'clock in the morning the first bombs fell over <placeName ref="Kielce">Kielce</placeName>. I went down with my parents into the cellar, but my father did not want to go. He said: "From this one cannot hide in the cellar." Then he "said" a chapter from the Psalms. My youngest brother was in the war on the Polish side. And with it I thought that the world had come to an end. To lose my youngest brother! I did not want to live any more. So naive I was then, to think that all I would lose in the war was my youngest brother. Once during the first days of September I got up especially earlyâ€”five o'clock in the morning. There wasn't a single German to be seen on the street. So I said: "Mother, dear, maybe it was only a dream. Maybe they are really not here." Unfortunately, it was not a dream.. They were there, and they were there for a long time. My father had to leave his home to hide somewhere in the suburb. The <term ref="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</term> was looking for him. I remained alone with my mother in five rooms, and all through the night I was clinging to the window, running around in search. Where are the people who used to come every night- every evening- to see my father? Where are the grandchildren, who are afraid to cross the street and to come upstairs? Nobody was there.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="263.303" end="x">Please tell the facts.</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="269.653" end="x">In November I departed with my parents from . . . (name of locality incomprehensible). We were told there was a prisoners' campâ€”Pshemish. I went across to the Russian side. I was not far from <placeName ref="Hrodna">Grodno</placeName>, and there I found everybody alive, and I looked for a place where I could bring over my parents. But in March it was already too late to bring somebody over, and so I remained in <placeName ref="Hrodna">Grodno</placeName>. Among the Russians the Jews lived just like all the other peoples.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="299.711" end="x">How did you get from <placeName ref="Kielce">Kielce</placeName> to <placeName ref="Hrodna">Grodno</placeName>?</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="302.242" end="x">I just got over there.</u>

                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="311.704" end="x">All alone without my folks, without a means to communicate with them. I remained in <placeName ref="Hrodna">Grodno</placeName>.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="320.943" end="x">How old are you now?</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="322.990" end="x">Thirty-four years. Yesterday was my birthday.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="326.724" end="x">On the eve of the New Year?</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="328.786" end="x">In <placeName ref="Hrodna">Grodno</placeName> the Jews lived just like the other people. First there were those who lived in Poland before, and then there were those who came from the zone occupied by the Germans. And they all lived together. Some lived in the synagogues or in the streets, but still they all lived together. Somehow I adjusted myself in <placeName ref="Hrodna">Grodno</placeName>. One has to live. The only thing was the terrible worry about my parents, and the homesickness. And all day and all night fire was pouring over <placeName ref="Hrodna">Grodno</placeName>, and within a single twenty-four hours sixty per-cent of the city was destroyed; and we remained alive. I lived on a street in No. 9; No. 11 burned down. No's. 27,23, and 9- I remained alive. At No. 11 and at one side of No. 9, there fell a bomb, destroying everything. I remained alive- and again there came the Germans. In a monstrous fashion they chased people through the streets, and it soon started all over. This was in the East, with special laws. In a few days I got the idea that my husband was alive.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="425.896" end="x">It occurred to you, or you knew?</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="427.442" end="x">I got the idea that my husband was alive and somewhere hiding in a village among the Germans, a prisoner. I wanted to run, but where to run? They didn't threaten me. I had to wait, and in a few days he came.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="446.589" end="x">He returned?</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="447.777" end="x">Yes.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="449.198" end="x">What does it mean- you got an idea'? Somebody has written to you?</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="451.714" end="x">No. At that time there came people who were together with him- with my man. And so they first brought me an idea.. [She apparently has used the Hebrew word "yidie" which means "message".] And my man succeeded in "blacking himself across." *The word "black" is a designation for illegal action, as in "black market" or "black papers," and it has become a verb- to do something illegal is often spoken of as "to black." *, to <placeName ref="Vawkavysk">Wolkowysk</placeName> and to mingle in with other prisoners. He had an uncle there, and so we got together. During the summer they still let us live in our apartment, although my husband had to work very hard, from six o'clock in the morning until six o'clock at night, together with all the others. And we still had at home some belongings, and we sold them, and we ate, and we hoped that possibly we might survive. The first of November we were driven into the <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">Ghetto</term>.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="502.699" end="x">Where?</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="503.574" end="x">In <placeName ref="Hrodna">Grodno</placeName>, into the <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</term>. They arranged two <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</term>, one in Slobodka [The name Slobodka often is used to designate the poorer suburbs, or slums.] and one <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</term> in the yard of the synagogue. At the beginning, the day when we came to the <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</term> the wires were not ready, and it did not make such a terrible impression. But the next day everything was fenced up and there was an inscription on the gate- "From here one does not return." . . . [She is very much upset and for the next two sentences the wire is not clear.] We have learned that the Jew should never give up hope, and his spirit should never falter. But the heart was heavy. It was hard to bear. I was in my ninth month. We used to live like affluent citizens, my father-in-law, my man, and my sister-in-law. Now we were given a room of eight and one-half cubic meters,-- no, squares; I don't know how many cubic meters there were. And there I was to give birth to my child. One day they opened the <placeName ref="Grodno Ghetto" type="camp">ghetto</placeName>, and every Jew was permitted to go into his home to fetch some things. Then my father-in-law went back to his home, and he saw the destruction of the home for which he has been working for thirty-years- and he returned gravely ill. He never got well again.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="583.424" end="x">What do you mean- he saw the destruction?</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="585.424" end="x">There was his home, and he saw how it was ransacked and ruined.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="588.768" end="x">Who ransacked and ruined it?</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="590.658" end="x">We left the house just as it was, with only the things on our body and a few bundles in our hands. And everything else had to be left.

There were left in <placeName ref="Slonim">Slonim</placeName> about two hundred Jews, out of a population of nine thousand Jews before the start of the slaughter, or possibly even more- I don't know.

And these two hundred Jews had numbers hung on them (the Christians made them wear them), and they had to report every day to the square, an place of roll call, and they were sent to work. Work! We too had worries about work! The day my man was working, we had hope to survive that day. But when people came to the gates of the <placeName ref="Grodno Ghetto" type="camp">ghetto</placeName> and said, "no more work required," that was a dark day. We knew it was coming. November 1, 1942, the <placeName ref="Grodno Ghetto" type="camp">ghetto</placeName> was surrounded. Every few steps stood an armed German, with his gun ready, and at some distance on the hill machine guns. They told us nothing, but they took us "to work." We knew what that meant. And nearby were Russians, Poles; not all but many were waiting for what they could inherit from the Jews. Possibly they had waited so that in case the Germans themselves would not put an end to us, they could step in.</u>

                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="915.747" end="x">So they could consummate the terrible deed. That is what we were told from <placeName ref="Brest">Brest-Litovsk</placeName> and other Ukranian cities. And in Russia, as far as <placeName ref="Volgograd">Stalingrad</placeName> and the Ural [mountains], the Germans did it themselves. They could not relinquish the "sacred labor", and they had their mission. However, it did not start that day, nor later. With a sadistic forethought, they told us: "Have no care, this will become a labor <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>, my word of honor." said Herr Ehrlich, the <term ref="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</term> chief, to the Community Council. "Mass murder! Oh, no; that is out of the question- deportation, neither!! It will be converted into a work-<term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>, no more loafing. And believe me, my word of honor." Believe his word of honor! In two weeks it started. First we saw them transporting the inhabitants of the smaller towns, from Slobodka,â€”on horse carts, old, broken down, sick people, and on foot the young ones; towards Bialystok they were led. And when they were through with the small towns, it commenced in Grodne. First came Slobodka. The first street. . . . my father,â€”that is, my father-in-law,â€”I must save my child. Possibly we should get away at night to some Poles, old acquaintances, and hide there. My husband, myself, my sister-in-law, and a girl friend who was with us, we shall get away to the <term ref="#vothG_partisans">partisans</term>, and Father with the child should remain with the Poles. But he refused. And so it was. He resigned himself to death. To me he said: "Take the child and save yourselves. Go to the other <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</term>. There they are still allowed to remain." I was the first to go over to the second <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</term> with the child. In a few days came my man. Father told him: "For the sake of the child, go!" He himself remained there. His younger daughter Zina- he could not abandon her, and they both went off with a transport, most probably to <placeName ref="Treblinka concentration camp" type="camp">Treblinka</placeName>. Within a week they started the <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</term> in the yard of the synagogue. The most horrible was that the Jewish Police (at the beginning we were not told about the horrible role they would have to play) they came and led us, assembled for the slaughter there, to the synagogue, at night. Every few nights we would sit upâ€”I, my man (the child was asleep, all dressed, and we expected the police to come after us. Every night we said Vida (the prayer of those who expect to die) of our own composition, and forgave each other, but they did not come. My man worked then as a carpenter (he is a lumber sorter by trade), and this kept us there. Once my man said: "I can't make peace with them. Our child must be saved even if we two shall die. We have nobody any more. You look like a Christian; get out with the child. Put it next to a Christian orphanage. Orphans also may be lucky sometimes. I can't want her to die." It snowed that night. It was 25 degrees cold. [Below zero centigrade.] Sixteen Jews fell at the gate in the first attempt to escape. I went over the wires in the second attempt, and my man handed me the child, and I carried her away.</u>

                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="1161.564" end="x">No, then they had no electric wires. He handed me the child. And I went out in the street. I removed the yellow patch, and I went down the street. It was eight o'clock. At nine o'clock it was curfew hour. I did not know where to go. All at once I remembered a Christian woman whom I happened to know, and I went to her and said: "This is all that I have got; take the child and carry it to an orphanage. Say, you have found it in the street. I am returning to my man, and we shall perish together." She started to wring her hands, a Christian woman whom I had possibly seen only twice before. And she said: "I am afraid (the Poles were threatened with death for such things); put her in the street. I will come out of the house with a neighbor woman; we shall come out as if by accident. I will pick up the child and take her tomorrow to the orphanage, but you go away immediately." And so she has taken my child. I went with her down to the door, and there I stood across the street, hidden in the gate, and I saw how my child was lying on the snow. And here, I could not pick her up, the child that I had brought into the world! I knew that that will save her life. That is what I hoped. [A few words in this sentence are not clear. She is sobbing, and even by slowing down the wire and listening to this section over and over, I have been able to understand only about three words. I do not think that the translation of the phrase "the child I brought into the world" is entirely correct.] In a few minutes she came out of the house and picked up the child. I ran away through the streets of <placeName ref="Hrodna">Grodno</placeName>, and I didn't think of the curfewâ€”that I might be caught,â€”and I didn't know how to get back to the <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</term>, as it was such a late hour. There was a Christian woman in the city, with whom I had once worked during the time of the Soviets. I stepped in to her, and a girl friend of mine was hiding there. I entered the house, and I said, "Panuvka *This is a respectful and at the same time endearing name for a Polish woman. *, I don't have my child any more. How light my hands feel!" Then she said, "Twenty-six hours you have suffered to bring her into the world, and now you will suffer as long as you live." I didn't ask her for muchâ€”just to keep me over night. She couldn't help me for much longer, because on Sunday no one could show himself in the city. The Germans were grabbing the people and dragging them to work in Germany. I wanted to return to the <placeName ref="Grodno Ghetto" type="camp">ghetto</placeName>. Then thousand Jews were deported that day. The <placeName ref="Grodno Ghetto" type="camp">ghetto</placeName> was surrounded. One couldn't get in, nor could one get out. Part were going to <placeName ref="Treblinka concentration camp" type="camp">Treblinka</placeName>, and to get in one also didn't know how. I ran into a Christianâ€”he was a working man. [Recording not clear.] I told him I am a Jewessâ€”"I can't get into the <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</term>." And he said, "Get out of the city. You do not look Jewish. Go where ever you can, but don't remain here. You see here it burns." And so I departed alone, without papers, into the woods. I did not know the roads. Through the woods, into a Russian village. I entered. "Give me some water." If one is alive, one has to drink water. And sometimes one has to eat. Everybody gave me something. I did not look Jewish, but they knewâ€”what else could be driving me in the snow through the woods? Everyone kept me for one night.</u>

                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="1377.401" end="x">The Christiansâ€”I can't complain. Everybody gave me warm water to wash myself. They gave me food, so that I should have strength to wander farther. And there was a preacherâ€”A Christian, a Catholic. He hid me "for strength" for eight days. But it drove me back to <placeName ref="Grodno Ghetto" type="camp">Grodno</placeName> to find out what was going on. The priest encountered some Jews that were going to work. She he asked them: "Do you know whether Jack Kovitzki is there?" So they said: "He is there, he has remained alive." Three thousand Jews were still in <placeName ref="Grodno Ghetto" type="camp">Grodno</placeName>. So he said, "Tell him that his wife is aliveâ€”that she does not want to remain among us. She wants to go back, and in a few days she will be back." The next week he took me out part of the way in a cartâ€”to go further, he was afraid. And I went alone towards <placeName ref="Hrodna">Grodno</placeName>â€”I can't remember how many kilometers. I arrived in <placeName ref="Hrodna">Grodno</placeName>.

                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="1452.596" end="x">Yes. He was a good business man; so he had an automobile and a driverâ€”a very decent person. He lives now in the yard of the house that once belonged to my father-in-law. So I went to him. He didn't know me, but I gave the name of Meyer Kovitzki, and he said: "Don't be afraid. You can be with me as long as you want." But he had a wife and a child, and I did not want to cause him anxiety. So I went down to the cellar, and he went to the <placeName ref="Grodno Ghetto" type="camp">ghetto</placeName> to find out about things, and Friday morning his own wife went with me through the streets, and she led me to the <placeName ref="Grodno Ghetto" type="camp">ghetto</placeName>. Then another Pole helped me to get in. But before I went in, he told me: "You know where you are going?" And I said, "Where is my man, and where is my place?" That was on Friday noon. I was there all night until five o'clock in the morning. At five o'clock in the morning again shooting and screaming. A new transport. And I and my husband went to this transport towards the synagogue. Then the whole night we stayed in the synagogue. In the synagogue it was crowdedâ€”heavy and crowded. One could not breathe. The whole night without a drop of water, and outside the shooting. At two o'clock in the morning we were driven out to the train. And my husband said: "No, you are not going to die. Because you have returned to me, is that why you should perish?" And I said, "I cannot beâ€”I am already tired. Maybe I shall rest in the grave." But he did not wish to understand, and just one street away from the train he pushed me into a gate, in spite of the guards, because it was still dark. We remained standing in the gateway until morning. We both took off our [yellow] patches. What to do now?</u>

My legs were covered with boils. Then my illness from beforeâ€”gall stonesâ€”In <placeName ref="Auschwitz concentration camp" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName>â€”in <placeName ref="Auschwitz concentration camp" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName> not to appear to the <term ref="#vothG_appell">appell</term> meant death, and still the supervisers of the barracks had pity on me and let me remain on the cot up to the last moment when already the <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term> men had come for roll call. Then they would drag me off the cot and lead me out. In <placeName ref="Auschwitz concentration camp" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName> I had a change of mind. I decided again to live. There appeared one day in my <term ref="#vothG_block">block</term> a distant cousin of mine, a girl, Nelly Kovitzka, a seventeen-year old girl. Her face was that of my little girl. And I was overcome with hope I should return. Maybe she is alive . . . [three or four words unintelligible]. And I started to fight again, to struggle for life, in <placeName ref="Auschwitz concentration camp" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName>. I became a- I was cleaning the <term ref="#vothG_block">block</term>. A <term ref="#vothG_block">block</term> that housed thirteen hundred people.

Then in spite of curfew I dressed up. In <placeName ref="Auschwitz concentration camp" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName> there was enough to wear. There was the clothing of the dead. They were burning people every day. The whole night the ovens would flame, and the skies red, dark red, just like . . . .

They were assembled there, and then they all were burned. I don't know. Possibly they were not even gassed, because of the horrible screams coming from there. Moreover one could somehow feel it. And there I was standing, and I mumbled to myself, and I said, "Dante was just a dog. They know it much better." And the Christian woman heard it, and she said to me [and here she imitates a voice of extreme surprise], "You know about Dante? How do you come to know anything about Dante?" She thought that I always must have been looking like thatâ€”like in <placeName ref="Auschwitz concentration camp" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName>. And from that night we became friends.</u>

In spite of the fact that she would beat us, and in spite of all that, she was fighting for the life of every prisoner. For the Christians she did not have to fight. Christians normally did not go to the ovens, only those who had died. But for the Jews she had to fight. Two years ago [this with some hidden light in her voice] on Rosh Hashona [the interview was taking place on Rosh Hashona of 1946, and she apparently refers to an incident exactly two years before] just two years ago, there was to be a selection. A selection was when they re-sorted the peopleâ€”who for the ovens and who should stay alive. So she took all the weak and the sick, including myself, and sent them away outside the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> for work, Aussenkomando, so they should not be present for the "selection." However, there was no selection afterwards. But I became convinced that she was really human, that if she mistreated and beat us, it was only because she herself wanted to survive and wanted us to survive.</u>

I stayed on in the <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term> for part of a year. I was gravely ill with gallstones.

So I replied, "You haven't been in a <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">ghetto</term>. You have not seen how Jews went away in transports with congealed nerves [verglievert]. A human being can cry himself dry; a human being clings to life, and up to the last moment there is a ray of hope and they are defenseless. And they have no arms. How can you say that? Maybe you just want to soothe your conscience talking that way." And the same day a miracle happened. The Jews seized the oven. They first threw in some forty <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term> men, and then, with them one hundred-fifty lost their lives, and a hundred-fifty ran away into the woods to the <term ref="#vothG_partisans">partisans</term>.

An answer has come to what she had said the about the Jews. If others would be saying it, I wouldn't care; but if such a Christian, who was so valuable to us and respected, [should think that way]â€”that we cared. Why should she say the Jews have no courage? That hurts. And now this happens. In October they began to assemble transports from <placeName ref="Auschwitz concentration camp" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName>. I had no hope to get away with the transport, because I looked very sick, but I dressed, and I painted myself for each <term ref="#vothG_appell">appell</term>, to give myself colorâ€”they shouldn't see my deadly paleness.</u>

                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="2516.887" end="x">Well, there would come transports of Jews from all over the world, and they did not know what their fate would be. So every woman still had these things. And they would lie on the dumps, and those who had access to the dumps would collect it and would give it to everyone who looked bad, to cover it up. And so I was heavily painted. One day they came to our <term ref="#vothG_block">block</term> and told us that we are going to the transportâ€”to lead us to a transport <term ref="#vothG_block">block</term>. And I too was selected during the <term ref="#vothG_appell">appell</term>. And so we went to <term ref="#vothG_block">block</term> 31, the transit <term ref="#vothG_block">block</term>. Here we remained for eight days. Then there was a selection and we were sent to the shower bath. That was a bathing room, where people would bathe, and afterward everyone was looked over. For me that was very dangerous; so a woman, a <term ref="#vothG_block">block</term> servant, told me: "Don't go in there. Simply sneak out through the other side and stand up with those on the right side, because externally you look well." And so I mingled in with three hundred other women, and I went away with a transport to <placeName ref="Lippstadt II concentration camp" type="camp">Lippstadt</placeName>. In <placeName ref="Lippstadt II concentration camp" type="camp">Lippstadt</placeName> there was work. In <placeName ref="Auschwitz concentration camp" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName> there was no work. In <placeName ref="Lippstadt II concentration camp" type="camp">Lippstadt</placeName> they manufactured ammunition, and there the strength to live returned to me. To work!â€”I should stamp cartridges for machine guns, with which the Germans would shoot (and these were the last munition factories) the Americans who came to liberate us! And because I looked so [decrepit] they thought that I was such a fool! In a few days I learned the mechanism of my machine, and in a few days I started to work very ardently. The assigned quota was twelve thousand, but I would produce fifteen thousand pieces. But fifteen thousand smaller ones and fifteen thousand larger ones, never the caliber that was prescribed. When they discovered it, there were eighty thousand rejected pieces. My foreman came over to me and said: "If you do it once more, I shall chop off your hand." So I said, "Oh [here her voice becomes ironical, and she speaks in perfect German], you can report that I am doing sabotage? Then they make me altogether kaput." "Oh, for that you are much too dumb!" I don't know, maybe he had noticed what I was doing, but it may have been too late, and he already was responsible along with me. I can't be so naive as to assume that the Germans wanted to cooperate with me against Hitler. Such do not exist. But to the last moment they had fate. In the faces of the Germans I read just like in a newspaper. They were very sad the last days. It was already the year 1945, in March. They still drove us to work, and they would beat us at every air raid alarm. But, thank God! The air raid alarm would last for twenty-four hours. They would run into the air raid shelter, and we would run right out into the yard. We would run out into the yard, and laugh, and the <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term> men would say to us: "Aren't you afraid? Do you think that your friends will spare you?" [She continues with laughter in her voice] "You are afraid! Why aren't you in the battlefield? All you are fighting with is eight hundred defenseless and weak women. That is the kind of heroes you are!" The girls thought that I was again insane, like I had been in <placeName ref="Auschwitz concentration camp" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName>. But it was indifferent to me. [Here again the record loses its clearness]. To die in such a fashion may be well worth while. The 27th of March we were driven out of <placeName ref="Lippstadt II concentration camp" type="camp">Lippstadt</placeName>.</u>

On the third day at dawn we remained standing in a little lane, deep in mud, and the top division leader was frothing at his mouth.

And he left us alone with all the <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term> men, and he himself ran away. So I said then to one of the girls, "You know, I don't know whether we shall survive, but he will not come back any more." So she says: "I have a half a bread and I give you this half a bread if that should happen the way you say." And I still thought that I would have a chance to eat that half a bread in case he should not return. But it has become very late. And it happened the first of April, 1945, a quarter of nine.

And here we were, almost crazy. We haven't a strip of a white thing. Somebody had a bandage around a wounded leg, and that bandage was raised at an approaching American tank, and the women prostrated themselves on the ground, kissing the wheels. The Americans thought it was a house of the insane. They looked at us. [I am not sure of the correct translation of the next few sentences.] And how we looked! All in tatters. [Her words are barely audible.] And speakingâ€”nobody could. We were all speechless. And then he understood, and two tears rolled down his face. [Again the text is not clear, she is very upset.] And until the others arrived, he wept with us. Not a Jewâ€”a Christian. And then they began to arrive, the tanks. It was Passover. The last day of it. And matzos [Unleavened bread, eaten by Jews at Easter] fell from the tanks. And chocolate and cigarettes. And they would jump off the tanks and they were kissing us. Us dirty and lousy ones. "Do not weep," they would say. But we wept more and again. And incessantly the tears ran. The Ninth Army had not seen any Jews in Germany, and we thought that we were the only Jewish survivors, and we did not want to live. But they consoled us. They were telling us that there were many other armies that have reached other <term ref="#vothG_lager">lagers</term> which were liberated. That was liberation. We were all dead sick. I was half swollen. Immediately the American army led us into homes. They burned everything we had on us, although we wanted to save the clothing. But it was all infected, and we were afraid to keep it. Dirty. And we changed our clothes, putting on whatever we could. We could take things, good things, from the Germans. We took it from the Germans [with irony in her voice], they gave it to us themselves. They were afraid now. We dressed [here her voice again breaks into sobs]. We washed ourselves, with soap, warm water, a clean towel, pure underwear. [She uses the English word "pure"]. Oh! The Americans themselves were crazy with joy. They now understoodâ€”"You are going to liberate human beings." And that army hadn't seen before those who were liberated. We were the first ones, and they were rejoicing like little children.

                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="3195.063" end="x">Yes, she [apparently the doctor's wife] also came from <placeName ref="Hrodna">Grodno</placeName>. She was evacuated from <placeName ref="Hrodna">Grodno</placeName> and came to <placeName ref="LÃ³dÅº">Lodz</placeName>. That Christian woman was held in jail with the child. An investigation was made, and it was found out that she had picked up the child on the street. They established then that it was a Jewish child, and they . . . [here she cuts off a word which she started to say and which apparently means "killed it." It is also possible that she did not finish the sentence because the meaning was obvious and because she was interrupted by the interviewer].</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="3215.026" end="x">How could they establish that the girl was a Jewish child?</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="3217.651" end="x">Theyâ€”I don't know how they established it. Possibly somebody reported to them, because the child looked later very much like my husband. The Kovitzki's were a well-known family, and they all resembled each other very much. It was also suspicious, because the woman was childless, and she had not given away the child to an orphanage.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="3241.964" end="x">Oh, she did not place the child in an orphanage?</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="3243.370" end="x">Because she loved the child, she kept the child like her own. And she left for me a presentâ€”a few pictures. I will show them to you right away. [As I remember it, she looked in her pocketbook.] Oh, no. I don't have them with me. And they buried the child three weeks before the Red Army marched in. When the Red Army arrived the woman interfered, requesting a permit to bury the child. It was said that I apparently was not alive any more; but they wanted to remove the child from the Christian cemetery. The Jewish cemetery was entirely desecrated.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="3277.224" end="x">Have you seen the woman afterwards?</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="3279.146" end="x">No, the woman I haven't seen any more.</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="3280.334" end="x">So, how did you get the pictures?</u>
                    <u who="#kaletskaA" start="3281.849" end="x">The pictures she left with a woman friend of mine who was saved. She lived on "<term ref="#vothG_aryan">Aryan</term> papers" near <placeName ref="Hrodna">Grodno</placeName>. About twelve kilometers from there. And this woman friend of mine went to this [Christian] woman and wanted to take my child back. So she gave her the pictures. And so I don't have the child. Then there was a rumor that my husband was alive, Jacob Kovitzki. Somebody wrote from <placeName ref="Kaunas">Kovno</placeName>, but I didn't know where he is, and a year has passed. I was unable to find him. Maybe he went into Russia, but so far there is nothing from him. Now I am working in <placeName ref="Pfalzheim">Pfalzheim</placeName>, in a kindergarten. There are twenty little Jewish children. And I play with them, and then I forget about all that. Again I have around me Jewish children. But after work, to come alone to my roomâ€”today is a holiday. Where are all mine, who used to celebrate the holidays with me? Thank God! There are Jews staying with me on a holiday. Not a holiday in <placeName ref="Auschwitz concentration camp" type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName>. But my people are no more. I am alone. [This whole section on Spool 167 was spoken with sobs, which are clearly heard on the wire. The woman was very much beside herself. I had a hard time to keep her in line with the microphone, and now I don't find a little episode which she told me, apparently after I had stopped the machine. It is not on the wire, but here it is, written from memory: "Last night, and that means on the first evening of Rosh Hashona we, like at home, prepared the holiday meal, and as was customary at home, we invited a soldier to share it with us. But this time it was not a poor soldier, away from home, who had to be fed, but an American Jewish soldier, who, accepting the invitation, brought us an armful of gifts, all kinds of American food and delicacies."]</u>
