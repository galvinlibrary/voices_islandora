                    <p>[This interview is unique as to the narrator as well as to its content. The interviewee, Rose Meltzak, age 13, belongs to the <placeName ref="OPEJ children's home">Bellevue</placeName> group and is one of the wards of Miss Kuechler [see Chapter 58]. As far as I remember, she was considered by the supervising personnel of the shelter house somewhat mentally retarded. My impression of her was rather that of a deeply disturbed child. It is clear that one could not expect from a child of her age any systematic narrative dealing with events spread over a five-year period. Her recollections are fragmentary and apparently confused as to time and sequence. Her Polish was excellent. She apparently had learned it from the peasants during her three years of hiding in the villages or in nearby forests. It is possible that due to the request that she speak in Yiddish the interview has lost in smoothness, precision, and color of style. The date of the interview must be set at September 8th, 1946. —D.P.B.]</p>
