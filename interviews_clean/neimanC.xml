                    <p>[Note: Although the translation is being made more than nine years after the interview, I seem to remember Mrs. Neiman very well. She was a tall, somewhat heavy set, healthy looking peasant women, typical of the Russian south. From her looks one could possibly give her up to thirty or thirty-five years of age, at least by American standards of appearance. That does not mean to say that she looked prematurely aged. Her Russian is perfect at average vocabulary level and so fluent that for translation purposes special devices had to be made to slow down somewhat her speech. What is more surprising is that her Yiddish, too, which we changed to at the end of the interview, is very beautiful and fluent. —D.P.B.]</p>

                    <u who="neimanC" start="165.903" end="x">They were Molokans [see note at end of chapter].</u>
                    <u who="boderD" start="167.544" end="x">Then you come from the Molokans!</u>
                    <u who="neimanC" start="170.216" end="x">Yes.</u>
                    <u who="boderD" start="170.622" end="x">So. And then?</u>
                    <u who="neimanC" start="172.357" end="x">And then they decided to change to Judaism, that this was already the real [right] religion. The first changed to Sabbatarianism and afterwards became real Jews.</u>
                    <u who="boderD" start="181.076" end="x">So they changed first to Sabbatarianism?</u>
