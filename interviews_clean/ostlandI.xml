The so-called infiltrees, that is the individuals who were running away from Lithuania and Poland or other regions which we are accustomed now to call the "iron curtain" states were behaving rather cautiously.

My father was the local rabbi and slaughterer. He sent me to study first to the great <term ref="#vothG_yeshiva">Yeshiva</term> of Ponevezys with the Ponevezys Rabbi Caneman; afterwards in the great <term ref="#vothG_yeshiva">Yeshiva</term> of Telsh under Rabbi Bloch whose son-in-law I have now become.</u>

We had to get out of there on account of significant events, so we arrived in <placeName ref="Telšiai">Telsh</placeName>. And from <placeName ref="Telšiai">Telsh</placeName>, on a Sunday, the day when the war started, we escaped to Krishek [I am not sure of the exact name]. There we found a second group of the <term ref="#vothG_yeshiva">Yeshiva</term> of <placeName ref="Telšiai">Telsh</placeName> and from there we departed for Russia.</u>
                    <u who="boderD" start="194.741" end="x">Excuse me. Why did people have to go away from there?</u>
                    <u who="ostlandI" start="198.306" end="x">There was a Polish <term ref="#vothG_yeshiva">Yeshiva</term> in the hamlet Rasein [I am not sure of the name] which the Soviets wanted to send away to Siberia. But the members of the <term ref="#vothG_yeshiva">Yeshiva</term> dispersed into the neighboring hamlets and when they were unable, in gathering them together, to distinguish who are the Polish <term ref="#vothG_yeshiva">Yeshiva</term> people and who are the Lithuanian [Yeshiva people] we stood pat [the expression apparently meant that "we would not betray them"] and that is why we had to get away from there.</u>

We, the young ones, have decided to run away to Russia but my father-in-law, the Rabbi of <placeName ref="Telšiai">Telsh</placeName>, with the other members of the <term ref="#vothG_yeshiva">Yeshiva</term> remained unfortunately there.

Rabbi Bloch bravely stepped forward from the [assembled] congregation [one word not clear]. The German representative reproached him that the Jews were sniping through the windows at the Germans, and for that reason the Jews are being threatened with severe punishment. Rabbi Bloch endeavored strongly to prove the meaninglessness of such an accusation; he explained how alien such action is to the Jews. There occurred some other incident in the negotiations but that was not reported to the community. When Rabbi Bloch returned from the negotiations to the congregation there took place a little meeting of the heads of the community . . .</u>

                    <u who="ostlandI" start="334.905" end="x">As a result of this meeting Rabbi Bloch presented himself before the community and talked to them in very severe terms and demanded from the community penitence. He explained that the only means to be saved in such a moment is a miracle. [the last two words are in Hebrew, I am not sure of the correct translation]. There is no natural way [to salvation]. He demanded from the community that they mend their ways with reference to three things; to preserve the purity of the family life, to observe the Sabbath, and to observe the dietary laws. This proposal was accepted by the community, and all like one, the pious and the free [thinkers], children and old ones, men and women, have resolved immediately to go through with it.</u>
                    <u who="boderD" start="372.730" end="x">Which three things [the interviewer did not understand clearly the three Hebrew terms]?</u>

The morning after they also called together the women and led them away to a different <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>. The first <term ref="#vothG_lager">lager</term>, the one for the men, was located 4 kilometers from the city of <placeName ref="Telšiai">Telsh</placeName>.

In two weeks, it was on that gruesome day of Tammuz [a midsummer month of the Jewish calendar, usually the hottest month of the mid-European summer] the men were assembled one evening, and they were submitted to horrible, horrible torture. They cut off their beards and they forced the older people to dance the "devils dance," they called it, and tortured and tormented them to the brink of death.</u>

Could it be that for him personally the highpoint of German violence came with the deportation so vividly described in "Bechuckotay," It suffices to quote only one verse from "Takhakho Bechuckotay" which expresses by no means the most extreme of the depredations that were to come over the Children of Israel if they should fail to observe the teachings of the Torah: "And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities; and I will send the Pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy." (Leviticus XXVI: 25) In general "Takhakho Ki Tahbo" lists the "mortal sins" while "Takhakho Bechuckotay" gives the most detailed aspects of punishment by catastrophe. Both the tendency to suppress even the thought of such sings referring in large measure to sex perversions on the one hand, while on the other hand the memories of the German inhumanities did not cease to haunt them, may also account for this repeated substitution of "Bechuckotay" for "Ki Tahbo." No wonder that Rabbi Ostland, as well as his father-in-law, Rabbi Bloch, as so many pious Jews, were struck by the vivid resemblance between the castastrophe brought upon them by the Germans who evoked into reality above any measure, most of the macabre prophecies of the "Takhakho Bechuckotay."] is being read.</u>

This one [the fence] was broken through in several places and there were dug for military purposes trenches and it was desecrated very badly.

And to find it in such a horrible state. All our efforts to fence it in again, and to throw out all the extraneous rubble which the former armies left there were for the time being, in vain, and the cemetery still remained in a terrible, regretable state.</u>

Like in those times there still take place maneuvers, military maneuvers and the destruction continues [I am not sure of the last few words]. Now about the other things. When afterwards the congregation began to grow in <placeName ref="Vilnius">Vilna</placeName> when the number of Jews increased, it became too crowded in number 19 German Street and it was decided to move to Zavalnya Street 35 to the Choral Synagogue. There we found two rooms adjoining the Choral Synagogue. There we established the congregation and after Rabbi Gutman left the town when he departed for Poland, we took over the rabbinate; also the shohets changed [in membership and personnel]. The parish developed rather well. It devoted itself to social service and it distributed during the course of the one summer '45- [the congregation] distributed up to 100,000 rubles for the poor, for those who returned from <term ref="#vothG_lager">lagers</term>, for strangers who arrived. The parish also devoted itself with the reestablishment of Jewish life [I am not sure of the translation]. They established a wide correspondence for the communication from friend to friend and other important work. At the end of '45 there were in <placeName ref="Vilnius">Vilna</placeName> already nearly 17,000 Jews. But unfortunately, there was no need in <placeName ref="Vilnius">Vilna</placeName> for more than one single house of prayer.
