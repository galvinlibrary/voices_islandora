I was born in <placeName ref="Warsaw">Warsaw</placeName>, and that which I am going to tell you I have lived through and seen with [my] own eyes and felt with my own body. The first happenings, the ones I want to tell you, because the whole story will take a little too long . . . I will begin right away with the transportations, when a few transports of Jews had already been sent away, and we began to organize the Young Fighters. We began organizing the Jewish Fighter Troops. These Jewish Fighter Troops were called Z.P.B. In Polish these initials stand for Jewish Fighter Organization, and which . . . and which had as its aim the fight against the exterminations of the Jews which were going on in Poland till . . . till . . . till the Judenrein [operation Jew-clean, a locality devoid of Jews, a Jew clean-out]. The procurement of weapons from [for?] the party [Polish underground?] was very difficult, because [of] money, the financial position of the organization, was very weak. It was scarcely enough to buy a few pistols for the organization [some words not clear].</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="131.792" end="x">From whom did one buy them, the pistols [?]?</u>
                    <u who="#piskorzB" start="135.111" end="x">What?</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="135.902" end="x">From whom did one buy them, the pistols?</u>
                    <u who="#piskorzB" start="138.249" end="x">Oh, yes. The pistols we bought. The comrades who worked in various places of the German troops, for instance, by the <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term> in the veterans homes, in the ammunition factory. These comrades bought up from the older military men, from the <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term>, from <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term> men from the <term ref="#vothG_wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</term>, from whoever had served in the army in the year '14. These men who were already older people, who remembered that war [1914-17] and what Jews had done for them, these people aided us very much, say with food, with bringing in food to the <placeName ref="Warsaw Ghetto" type="camp">Ghetto</placeName>, and with arms. This still wasn't all. For this we needed finances. The procurement of finances was . . . we procured the finances thus, that we went at night, dressed in black, in black rubber boots, black coats, masks on the faces, and with revolvers in the hand. We went from door to door to Jews, to rich Jews, about whom we knew approximately how much money they had, and we demanded from them money. The money we didn't always get. But when we threatened with death or with other things, then we got the money. And we offered . . . we left, every time when we took from anybody a sum of money, we left receipts, such receipts so that after the war that particular person should be able to claim from the . . . the fighters, or from other institutions which would be created after the war. And so not all Jews agreed to this. But against threats there was no way out, and they aided with something. For this money we also bought other . . . the things which we needed for the [fighter] units. But in the meantime the organization was created which also went under the name of Z.P.B. which was composed of thieves and people of the <placeName ref="Warsaw">Warsaw</placeName> underworld, also of Jews who went around to procure money in our name. This money went for them, into their pockets. And the money which we procured went for the things needed for our society, the Jews of our organization. And so it happened, a few days before <term ref="#vothG_pesach">Pesach</term>, in the year '43 it happened that they prepared for a Judenrein in the <placeName ref="Warsaw Ghetto" type="camp">Warsaw Ghetto</placeName>.</u>

                    <u who="#piskorzB" start="314.094" end="x">An extermination process against the Jews. To remove the Jews from <placeName ref="Warsaw">Warsaw</placeName>. The Jews . . . the Jews were . . . so the panic in the <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">Ghetto</term> was very great. People in the <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">Ghetto</term> went around like poisoned mice, one can say. And they shouldn't . . . people prepared themselves. People made various hideouts. People brought food, edibles. People bought and hid it so that one should be able to have food for at least three years, a year, a year and a half. Because according to what was heard from the Germans, from Hitler's speeches, that at five minutes to twelve . . . should the war end at twelve, [then at] five minutes to twelve all the Jews will be exterminated in . . . in Poland, just like in all the occupied countries that the Germans had envaded. And so people made preparations, that approximately the battle will still take not exactly till twelve, like Hitler said, but it can last half a year, and even a year. So people prepared food for a certain time. The org- . . . the organization also prepared itself, and on the day when the . . . the Judenrein happened, well, on that night—it was on . . . on the first, the fourth month in the year '43—the people have . . . and so the organization prepared the step towards battle. The organization numbered about [a] hundred and seventy people, and in the last two days the number came up close to two hundred. All were provided in the way of weapons, ammunition, clothes. In the middle of the battle . . .</u>

                    <u who="#piskorzB" start="415.418" end="x">Well, the <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term> clothing, because even inside the <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">Ghetto</term>, deep inside the <term ref="#vothG_ghetto">Ghetto</term>, there was a shop, a factory of German clothing.

                    <u who="#piskorzB" start="435.437" end="x">And so it was. It was dangerous, but at night when nobody saw, we sneaked out. And that clothing . . . we hid them . . .</u>
                    <u who="#boderD" start="443.258" end="x">I mean one Jew shouldn't take the other one for an <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term>, and he should not . . .</u>

                    <u who="#boderD" start="462.609" end="x">Yes.</u>
                    <u who="#piskorzB" start="463.060" end="x">Because an <term ref="#vothG_ss">SS</term> man didn't dare to walk around among Jews, because he knew what awaited him.</u>

It happened . . . at night our comrades have . . . the comrades of the organization have stood around and around the wall. Because there had been erected around and around the <placeName ref="Warsaw Ghetto" type="camp">Ghetto</placeName> a brick wall which had on top three tiers of barbed wire, and [words not clear] one shouldn't be able to climb over.

                    <u who="#piskorzB" start="666.292" end="x">Herself. She took her own life. And indeed later, the same thing . . . it happened that the comrades, who were supposed to go on a patrol to see where the . . . the Germans were, what they were doing, and when they were doing . . . one did . . . not everyone had the desire to go, because they knew they are going for certain death, but when the name of this [woman] comrade was mentioned he went. And . . . and the . . . the time passed. The <placeName ref="Warsaw Ghetto" type="camp">Ghetto</placeName> was bombarded with incendiary bombs, with the gas bombs, with tear gas, in order to get the people out of the hideouts. The <placeName ref="Warsaw Ghetto" type="camp">Ghetto</placeName> was completely burned. People saw that the battle will not last longer, we won't be able to carry out the fight any longer. And so it was decided . . . a proposal was put forth that one should escape from the Ghetto. But how should one escape? It was decided to blow up one wall of the <placeName ref="Warsaw Ghetto" type="camp">Ghetto</placeName>, and a few hundred people should pass through and only at the end should the organization . . . the comrades escape. And this plan was indeed executed. A wall was blown up. This is on Platz Muranow where there was the . . . the . . . main square of the small . . . of the <placeName ref="Warsaw Ghetto" type="camp">Ghetto</placeName>, that later on also was destroyed [?] in a certain part, was . . . was blown up. A few hundred people, women with children and older people, were thrown through, sent through that . . . through that wall, through that blown up one. A part of these people were killed by the Ukrainians who were standing near the fences, and so on, and were shot. Whoever had luck saved his life, he remained alive. And also, after a certain time—this was already in the fourth month of the battle . . . [correction] in the fourth week of the battle—the comrades decided that one cannot go on fighting any more, that the rest of the comrades who are here should escape. I had in the hideout . . . I had a mother with a cousin. And this mother with the cousin I couldn't leave behind. So I proposed [that] all the comrades should escape and I will remain with the mother, because, all in all [?], the mother looked like a Jewish child [person belonging to the Jewish 'race'], a dark, Jewish woman. She had a Semitic face. And so it wasn't possible with the mother to escape to the <term ref="#vothG_aryan">Aryan</term> side, because it would surely be detected. And one heard even about the people who did escape. They are caught. They look like Jews. They don't have any documents, so they are killed in the <term ref="#vothG_gestapo">Gestapo</term>. So death . . . death is either way. So I proposed that I will remain with the mother. How long I can make the food last? There in the cellar, so we shouldn't be discovered, so I will remain. After this the comrades escaped, about thirty, forty people,
                        through the canals. Through the sewers they escaped to the <term ref="#vothG_aryan">Aryan</term> side and there to <placeName ref="Lublin">Lublin</placeName>, the center of the <term ref="#vothG_partisans">partisans</term>. I remained with the mother. On the seventh of May . . . from the sixth to the seventh of May the people have . . . You see, people walked around at night and searched [for food and friends?] I, too, went out at night with my mother, with the people with whom I was hidden there. With distant relatives I was hidden. And the people have . . . the people asked around, 'Where is my mother? Where is my father? Where are my brothers and sisters?' So as to be able to find out. And later it did come out, right the next morning. It was about six, seven in the morning. It was already dawn. There came the <term ref="#vothG_gendarme">gendarmerie</term>, and also among them was a Jew who asked about a father who had been searching at night. That . . . and that same young man denounced us.
