Nearly 10,000 of those arrested were women and children. Although Mrs. Precker saved herself by bribing the two French policemen who came to arrest her, the fact that she was a French-born Jew might have played a role in her release.

Until the collapse of the Italian fascist government and the withdrawal of Italian troops from the zone in September 1943, some 50,000 Jews, among them the Mrs. Precker and her family, had sought refuge there. Most refugees, like Mrs. Precker and her family, at first went to the city of Nice. After the departure of Italian troops, the family moved to Cannes.</note></u>

A convoy of some 1,300 Drancy internees left for Auschwitz on July 31, 1944. Mrs. Precker and her family narrowly missed sharing their fate.</note></u>
