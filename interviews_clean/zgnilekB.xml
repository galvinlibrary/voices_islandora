                    <p>[Introductory Note: This interviewee proudly insisted on speaking English. Considering that she learned it only in school before her imprisonment in a concentration camp, which lasted for several years, she was doing indeed very well. Of course, her present job with the JDC, an American organization, must have given her ample opportunity for improvement. There is, of course, some confusion of tenses, and pronouns are frequently omitted. We reproduce the interview verbatim. —D.P.B.]</p>
